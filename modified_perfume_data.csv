26,thurible,Rook Perfumes," the best kept secret about incense in perfumery is how magically versatile it is- it can be smoky, of course, but also resinous and animalic, or sparkling and fresh, or opulent and narcotic. thurible is the rare incense scent that seems to contain it all, a wonderfully complex ode to this beloved material that still coalesces into a beautifully wearable and stylish signature. a sweet, clove-forward spice and herb blend supplements the church-ier aspects of the incense- cool, smoky, and sheer- while warmer, more resinous facets intertwine with rich, earthy labdanum and patchouli. a third chord- clean, sparkling incense with fresh rose and oakmoss- pulls everything together with a timeless twinkle. a must-smell for all incense lovers, thurible is a comfortably sophisticated incense scent we're head over heels for."," clove, ash, sage, black pepper, labdanum, incense, rose, patchouli, leather, ambergris and moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
27,suede,Rook Perfumes," polarizing and provocative, rook's take on leather is perhaps not as smooth as the name suede might suggest, but for those who love animalic, realistically raw leather, there's nothing else like it. smoky, rugged, untanned leather is the star, still recognizably charred and fleshy, harkening back to times where leather was still made by hand. it weaves in a rich tobacco leaf, earthy, sweet, and natural, like the leathermaker was sitting at his tanning bench with a rolled cigarette dangling from his lips. while a delicate undercurrent of smooth suede makes the name more than just playful irony, those who only love the most delicate leather scents may want to look elsewhere. but for those who love raw, animalic, smoky leather, this is a magic potion not to be missed."," suede, tobacco leaf, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
28,amber,Rook Perfumes," when we say we love amber scents, we don't just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive ""amber"" note in perfume. which is good, because neither ingredient is anywhere to be found in rook's new amber scent. what we really love, however, is the spirit of amber- powerful, sensual, spiritual, and comforting, all at once- and that, this amber has in multitudes. it opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark. a tonka bean base adds a touch of familiar vanillic tone, but stripped of the typically creamy dessert trappings. this amber glows with the intensity of late summer dusk in the wilderness, satisfyingly sweet but also exhilarating and primal. in other words, exactly what you'd hope for from rook."," saffron, smoke, incense, amber, maple, black musk, tonka bean and resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
29,interlude black iris,Amouage," inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an iris flower by georgia o'keeffe, interlude black iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. just as with the original interlude man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, black iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. the intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. if interlude man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, interlude black iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?"," bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41899.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

96,midnight saffron,Tom Daxon," lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. midnight saffron, born of tom daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. as the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of france and bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. as midnight saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. as we mentioned at the top, midnight saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are."," saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

106,against nature,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," inspired by joris-karl huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. like the journey of huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul. vivid and intriguing, this is most certainly not a scent for everyone- something huysmans would most certainly approve of."," pink pepper, lemon, juniper, green notes, metal, jasmine, ylang ylang, lacquer, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
107,cornaline,Anatole Lebreton," when anatole lebreton conceptualizes a new fragrance, we sit up and take notice. after all, his brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging or signature notes- a lebreton scent is a uniquely formed work of art, with rustic, romantic and fantastical elements all hypnotically intertwined to create scents that stand alone as works of individual creativity. cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. cornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color. first, geranium shines forth with spicy assertiveness, followed by an energetic vibration of orris, and a fruit-inflected, beautifully sweet ylang ylang. now, the fruits and florals explode forth, painting a vivid mural of springtime delights with distinct touches of hyacinth and ""belle du jour"" mirabilis, a perfect blend of spicy and fruity. and finally, an increasingly sensual bed of musk and vanilla glows with the poised relaxation of twilight. joyful yet masterfully restrained, opulent yet luminous, cornaline is another opus from one of niche perfume's brightest lights."," carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
108,bluebijou,Piotr Czarnecki," for far too long, ""blue"" has been used to describe the most generic of fragrances- blandly masculine, synthetically aquatic, outright boring. but blue is so much more interesting than that- a blue scent should be hypnotically deep, harmoniously balanced, compellingly full of life. enter bluebijou, a unique, vibrant, unrestrained reinterpretation of the blue scent. instead of scratchy, synthetic freshness, bluebijou delivers juicy, sumptuous blueberry, bright violet, rich cocoa, and unmistakable truffle, all atop an impossibly deep base of dark oud and deeply boozy cognac. it's sweet, smooth, juicy and magical- and you'll never look at an underwhelming ""blue"" department store scent the same."," violet, blueberry, cacao, truffle, tobacco, dark chocolate, cognac, oud, cashmeran, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

113,london,Widian," the sapphire collection, a new collection by widian, formerly aj arabia, is the perfect fusion of east meets west. the east: widian, an arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of sheikh zayed's grand mosque and the modern arab spirit in the city of abu dhabi. the west: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest western cities, such as london, paris, and new york. traditional arabic perfumery meets western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, east and west. london is widian's first entry in the sapphire collection, and it nails the east-meets-west theme with aplomb. on the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. but the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the far east sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from london and towards the east. its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the arabian peninsula.  simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to london, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when eastern exoticism meets western polish. london truly is a winning proposition."," oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
114,buonissimo,Hilde Soliani," ask anyone what their fondest scent memory is, and chances are, the scent of baking bread will be invoked. for luckyscent's 15th anniversary, our most inventive gourmand nose, hilde soliani, created her loveliest, most nostalgia-inducing scent, exclusively for us - buonissimo. imagine waking up in a charming italian town over a simple breakfast of a hot cup of foamed cappuccino and a freshly baked sweet pastry. the fantastical hilde brings this vision to life in the form of what the italians call brioche- the fair lovechild between a flaky french croissant and clasically airy french brioche. it's perfectly buttery, and fluffy with a sugared vanilla. but it wouldn't be a hilde soliani without that how-did-she-do-that element, and here, she's captured the sweet egg wash over the pastries' gentle slopes, caramelized a crispy golden brown from the oven.  and don't forget - from beginning to end, like every proper italian day, the dark swirl of espresso and cream is ever-present, lending its mature sophistication. this is a serious must have for any gourmand connoisseur.","vanilla, cream, cappuccino",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46639.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
115,boronia,Grandiflora," boronia is a very unusual fruity-floral composition based around a small, shrubby flower native to western australia, the eponymous boronia. some varieties of the shrub can smell warm and woodsy, but this particular variety smells fruity and spicy, like a handful of ripe apricots dusted in cinnamon and lemon peel. there is even a minty freshness to the topnotes reminiscent of cassis leaf. the boronia also lends the perfume an ionone-rich feel, the silvery powder of violets and iris joining with a distinctive plum jam note to create an almost winey floral bouquet. the hay-like tones of a golden immortelle provide a textured backdrop to the florals, giving the scent a pleasantly rustic, early fall harvest feel: dried grass, hay, tobacco leaves turning to brown paper in the sun, and the dusty red earth of the australian outback. black tea and apricots create a suede impression, but it's a credit to the perfumer that the foodier notes of caramel, fruit, and cognac are never allowed to turn boronia into a gourmand. it is fruity and rich, yes, but balanced by the tannic sharpness of tea and hay, the scent manages to stay elegantly dry. if you love the autumnal, plummy darkness of chypres such as voleur de roses and mon parfum cheri par camille, then you will love boronia too."," boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
116,ambilux (formerly 50ml dambiguite),Marlou," ambilux is ambiguous only in the sense that it is puzzling that a list of largely plant-based spices, resins, and florals adds up to something so unapologetically animal. the first blast has our eyes rolling back in pleasure: a thickly furred musk redolent of warm animal, dripping tallow candles, and the salty skin of a loved one. that there are new perfumes out there that dare to challenge the great muscs khoublai khan and musc tonkin is a pleasant surprise. although ambilux is quite different to these perfumes, it possesses the same earthy, no-holds-barred sensuality and a texture that is distinctly retro in its velvety thickness. the creator intended for this perfume to reflect the unique olfactory fingerprint we all carry, our own personal aroma, imprinting onto others as we touch, kiss, and make contact. but like its distant progenitor, l'air de rien, it also captures the smells of our nest: dusty spaces, books, pots overflowing with flowers, and old wood.  despite the listed notes, what we predominantly pick up is a warm, oily sheep's wool nuance  waxy and lanolin-like, deeply inviting to the touch. costus root is what gives the perfume its arousing animal fattiness, but it is used subtly here, woven into the other notes for an effect that is intimate but not uncomfortably close. the sweet, slippery feel of the woolen musk is cut with a bright, almost briny ylang note, aerating the heart with a salty breeze. in the drydown, castoreum gives us nuances of dry, smoky tobacco and leather. ambilux captures all the grimy intimacy of our own bodies, our loved ones, and the crawl spaces of our inner sanctum: it's sexy, but also comfortable and elegant.     update: ambilux is a new version of the beloved 50ml d'ambiguite, made a bit lighter, warmer, and more wearable while retaining all the animalic sensuality of the original.)"," pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

200,maai,Bogue Profumo," maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. it opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. the plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before ifra/eu regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary kouros or muscs koublai khan. as maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. at the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. in its drydown, maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.we found maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. a symphonic masterpiece in the vein of jubilation 25 and kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur."," tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

207,2022 generation homme,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," 2022 represents an important year for the future of the middle east: as qatar will play host to the world cup, the eyes of the world will be upon a great gathering in the heart of the region, an event that, at best, has the potential to demonstrate true sharing among more developed nations and states that are still struggling. against this backdrop, stephane humbert lucas presents 2022 generation man, a fragrance that employs a unique blend of timeless opulence and sleek modernity to represent the distinct character of today's sophisticated middle eastern man.2022 generation man opens with an unexpectedly bright burst of juicy blackcurrant and zesty yuzu, kept cool with a spritz of fresh mint. it's a wonderful twist for those expecting a by-the-numbers oud and spices, establishing a portrait of a modern young middle easterner prepared to greet the global community with as much style and warmth as imposing sophistication. the oud, of course, is present; a fabulously rich heart made from prized cambodian agarwood of such rare distinction that it can hardly be compared to the synthetically sharp or pungently sour ouds of lesser brands. this is an oud that asserts its own value, dry and distinguished, powerful and almost translucent, connecting the fragrance to an unbroken line of tradition without ever dragging the composition backwards. as a base of rich spices and warm balsamic musk swell in support, the timeless luxury of middle eastern perfumery blends seamlessly with modern creativity for a sexy, sophisticated scent any man could wear with confidence.  presented in a beautiful black lacquered bottle with a handcrafted gold cap, 2022 generation man is more than just a striking fragrance; it's a masterful statement."," yuzu zest, blackcurrant, mint, cambodian oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
208,shihan,Piotr Czarnecki," a personal labor of love, shihan is piotr czarnecki's tribute to the natural connection between fragrance and dance. as a professional ballroom dancer and dance instructor in his native poland, czarnecki had long employed a lifetime obsession with scentmaking to compose fragrances meant to accompany his routines and those of his students, to, in his words,create their own atmosphere. but while it may have been originally created for a select few students, shihan, a warm, exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand, is simply too good to keep secret.  as with a finely crafted dance program, his fragrance (formerly called sensei) weaves around its central composition with graceful fluidity, revealing wondrous new aspects with each passing moment. the foundation of exceptionally high quality, largely natural ingredients: in the opening, cuban tobacco and bitter arabic coffee lend earthy depth to a boozy warm whiskey accord, while colonial spices enliven a mysterious heart of frankincense and myrrh, evoking visions of grand, exotic opulence. a musky amber base purrs with carefully extracted labdanum and sweet ambrette, dreamily resinous.a perfect blend of lively spice and warm richness that will delight fans of gourmands and orientals alike."," whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
209,black gemstone,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," a fragrance named for the sacred cornerstone of the very center of the grand mosque of mecca demands a refinement and respect for both subject and composition. but stã©phane humbert lucas is no mere tourist, and black gemstone, through its captivatingly complex blend of myrrh, lemon and smoky incense, indeed inspires a profound respect bordering on wonderment. the black stone of mecca is purported to have fallen directly from heaven, and the ingredients of black gemstone are clearly intended to come as close to otherworldly as possible. pristinely tart italian lemon, rich olibanum-derived incense and three hand-selected types of cedar are but a few of the treasured components, but the true centerpiece is an extraordinary myrrh, painstakingly distilled down into a resinous tar that, like the black stone itself, projects a presence that far exceeds its size. and like a true religious experience, black gemstone follows no linear path- from moment to the moment, the tartness of the lemon, smokiness of the incense and balsamic sweetness of the myrrh dance around one another with an unpredictability that promises to make each individual encounter profoundly unique.presented in an elegantly understated black lacquered bottle, with a unique hand-milled black honeycomb top and a small faceted black swarovski crystal."," infusion of three cedars lemon, myrrh, tar, incense, teak, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
210,oumma,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," stã©phane humbert lucas describes oumma as a study of the contrasts of agarwood (oud), a substance he views with mystical reverence. a single sniff of oumma can more than explain why: based around the finest burmese oud and buttressed by moroccan rose, egyptian jasmine and peruvian balsam, this fragrance is drawn from the rarest sources on the planet and yet, it hardly feels earthly at all. instead, oumma seems to rise from the ground, stretching out each extraordinary facet of its central ingredient until the smoky, spicy wood and subtly sharp, medicinal aphrodisiac properties that make up the duality of oud seem to exist simultaneously, suspended in mid-air. simply put, oumma is a fragrance that makes you look to the heavens.a dry, spicy rose and elegantly savory saffron hover beneath, but this is nothing like the lavish-yet-rote oud-rose pairings widely available elsewhere. rather, these exceptional ingredients, each deserving of a starring role in a different composition, combine with smoke-saturated cade ash to build the earthly pyre from which this singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher.even the bottle itself seems prepared to leave the ground: shiny and silver, as bright and reflective as the mid-day sky, finished with a polished silver cap and a swarovskidiamond placed on the crown. we've never experienced an oud quite like this."," egyptian jasmine, moroccan rose, peruvian balsam, balsam tolu, ashes of cade, burmese oud, nagarmotha.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
211,rose de petra,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," petra: capital of the nabataeans, a wonder of ancient engineering, an ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely into the side of the mountain thought to be the biblical sinai itself. words cannot hope to describe the majesty of the place known as the rose city, but stã©phane humbert lucas chose a far more appropriate medium with rose de petra, a breathtaking floral that honors both halves of its namesake with a rose equal parts refreshingly natural and sumptuously mysterious. we like to think of rose de petra as a journey down an ancient stone canyon, with wild roses in full bloom springing from every crack in the rock. what begins as a simple, beautiful journey opens itself to mystery and wonder- that clean, bright rose we smell is no single, simple note but rather an intense rose oxide given body and mouthwatering juiciness from pomegranate and litchi. as the heart of pure, natural bulgarian rose expands, so too do the spices- cardamom, cumin and pepper, intense enough to invigorate but light enough to place this scent a world away from a typical rose chypre. here, yet again, we see the necessity of lucas' uncompromising commitment to top quality ingredients, as rose de petra's deceptively simple formula belies an astounding integrity we would not have thought possible from reading the notes alone. like a fully irrigated city carved into a mountain in the middle of the desert, rose de petra is a masterpiece of construction that will knock you over with its beauty.presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored swarovski crystal placed on the crown."," rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, bulgarian rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
212,soleil de jeddah,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the saudi arabian city of jeddah, the bride of the red sea, gateway to mecca and medina. to honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, stã©phane humbert lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of russian leather, madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. like the multi-faceted city of jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. the initial brightness of soleil de jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. in fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that soleil de jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. once the russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results."," lemon, roman chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, russian leather, vanilla from madagascar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

314,freeway,4160 Tuesdays," freeway is the story that jumped, fully formed, into sarah mccartney's mind when she visited scent bar one hot summer's day and stepped out onto the hot asphalt outside. a friend was just driving away, and the smell of his maserati's exhaust mixed with the scent of the orange blossom in the air and the tang of hot, melting asphalt...sarah was inspired then and there to create an urban take on orange blossom exclusively for luckyscent, to help celebrate our 15th anniversary. the idea was to take the fresh, sugary brightness of orange blossom and sully it with a host of gritty, determinedly non-floral smells from an urban environment, making for a scent with a sexy kick in its tail: think flowers crushed under a rubber-soled sneaker. sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil here for its plummy citrus aroma but also for its fuel-like facet; the result is sweet orange blossom water spilled on hot tar. for such a popular note, orange blossom is easy to get wrong  too sweet and it's juvenile, too honeyed and it can turn sleazy. freeway does orange blossom right, pitched exactly halfway between bright and dark. dry woods, tobacco, and grassy cannabis notes dry out the tarry orange blossom until it smells more like old paper and less like a flower. a light, foamy vanilla froths around the dry, papery notes for a result that smells like eating a thimbleful of insanely rich, perfumery orange blossom gelato in an antique book store. urban and urbane, freeway is the scent of l.a.'s future, when, as sarah says,all cars are solar powered and the freeways have cycle lanes, orange groves, jasmine hedgerows, and picnic areas."," mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64623.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

316,une amourette roland mouret,Etat Libre d'Orange," ""an unforgettable love affair, "" une amourette is the result of a portentious conversation between etat libre d'orange and groundbreaking fashion designer roland mouret. every bit as iconoclastic in the world of design as eldo is for french fragrance,  mouret's work demonstrate a preternatural eye for sensuality,  flow and innovation,  a gift for draping fabric over skin in the same way that etienne de swardt's fragrances drape the skin. so,  of course,  a collaboration was inevitable- but what a collaboration this is. soft and romantic,  yet striking and avant-garde,  une amourette is a beautifully woodsy iris that wears like the most flattering couture you can imagine. it starts with the iris note- sharp but not stark,  with just the right amount of floral lushness to allow the vanilla-tinged akigala wood to slowly develop underneath,  adding a purringly seductive,  subtly muscular form to the flowing silhouette of the scent. as it dries,  the gentle earthiness of the iris further gives shape to the body beneath,  evoking a softer-but still distinctive- carnality that has us positively swooning. some partnerships are so obvious you wonder why they've taken so long to manifest,  but in the case of une amourette,  we think we know the answer- they wanted to keep us waiting."," iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47750.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
317,le cri de la lumiere,Parfum d'Empire," inspired by the light towards which all beings reach out whether entering or leaving this world, le cri de la lumiã¨re employs a sparse framework of just three notes: ambrette, iris, and rose. but for all its elegant minimalism, this is a scent with plenty to say. ambrette, with its tart nuances of green apple, pear, and grappa, is first to announce its presence, bathing the scent in a halo of crystalline light. the opening pitches high, with an almost citrusy sparkle. the iris note, at first rooty and then bready, moves in to flesh out the structure, like a length of suede draped over a metal chair. comparisons between this perfume and another ambrette-iris composition, chanel no. 18, are natural  but le cri de la lumiã¨re is far brighter and drier affair, with a delicate sourness absent from the chanel. as silvery as a glass of white vermouth, the scent gains a blush in its cheeks thanks to the late addition of rose. the ambrette wraps around the rose and iris, bedding them down in a soapy muskiness that feels both clean and sensual. the texture of this scent is dappled; in turns sheer and cloudy, bright and shaded, like a glass of pastis into which a drop of water has just been stirred. le cri de la lumiã¨re is a fragrance with noble lineage: aristocratic, haughty, and a little mysterious."," ambrette, rose, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

459,20 20,J.F. Schwarzlose," berlin, 1920: the global excess of the roaring twenties is in full swing. artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of new york, london, and paris. and in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- chic, from j.f. schwarzlose & sã¶hne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable german ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a roaring twenties of our own, j.f. schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of chic with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes. the result is vintage floral elegance buoyed by a modern, irreverent buzz of woodsy energy- a fragrance both timeless and contemporary, with an indomitable spirit of creative expression and joie de vivre. it's impossible to say what the next decade may hold, but with 20|20, we can at least ring in the '20s in style."," rose, benzoin, patchouli, amber woods, pink pepper, geranium",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
460,angelys pear,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," for patricia de nicolai, nature is the ultimate inspiration. and few fragrances are quite as regal, as inspiring, as downright mouthwatering as the pear. since its introduction to europe from asia during roman times, this uniquely complex fruit has been treasured, considered a ""fruit of the castle"" and a sign of high social distinction. it's this inspiration, specifically as it relates to the loire valley of france, where both delicious pears and great castles abound, that serves as the focus of angelys pear, named for both the loire city of angers, and the lys, the symbolic flower of french kings.and the scent itself? a divinely sweet and juicy pear note, enhanced by a bouquet of rose and jasmine, highlighted by invigorating oakmoss that suggests a hint of a classical chypre. ephemeral and serene, full of purity, light, and calm, this eau de toilette perfectly illustrates the fabled bounty of the loire valley."," bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313061.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
461,ligno,Jeroboam," when the devilish patchouli meets the pheromonal grey amber... the result is beyond a perfume, it becomes an alchemists' potion with an aphrodisiacal promise. in vanina muracciole's creation, ligno is a woody extract with amber at its heart, wrapped by the signature enigmatic musks that gives an unapparelled volume to each jeroboam perfume."," bergamot, sage, saffron, cistus , grey amber, fir balsam, rose essence, tonka bean, patchouli, enigmatic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/714011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
462,unnamed,BYREDO," one can't deny that unnamed got people talking. not just about this nameless perfume, but about how we all use note lists to help us form an idea of the smell. let's close our eyes for a moment, breathe it in, and let our nose lead the way...brrrrrr... cold. we smell the gin-and-tonic snap of juniper berry, and the cold, rooty gleam of orris. the texture is peppery, silvery, and transparent, like a light mist curling around the trees in a northern fir forest. there is also a mysterious red berry note weaving in and out  an ice-covered raspberry that adds a dollop of deliciousness. damp lichen and moss add an inky, forest tone to the scent-- creating a gloomy but captivating atmosphere. only one thing is certain: you get to call this heavenly fragrance any name you wish."," gin accord, pink pepper, orris root, violet, tree moss, fir balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
463,hongkong oolong,NEZ,"hongkong oolong captures the image of china as i see it in a few years, with its contrasts and modernity. this fragrance juxtaposes my interpretation of tea with the specificity of oolong. designing a fragrance is always about adapting reality. i thought about what it is in tea that gives pleasure and comfort. so, i built the composition around musky notes, which reveal themselves generously, like the long finish you get with a mature tea. spicy inflections of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger reproduce the warming effect of a hearty mouthful. a base of sandalwood and tonka bean round off the accord with a milky sweetness. then, i incorporated the specific characteristics of oolong and that floral lightness; jasmine, honeysuckle, with its fruity and honeyed accents, and a touch of magnolia, which i associate iwth china. lastly, hints of leather, incense and moss transform the green, vegetal freshness of the tea leaf to bring out its fermented character.","tea, oolong, musk, spicy, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger, sandalwood, tonka bean, sweet, milky, jasmine, honeysuckle, fruity, honey, magnolia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/770016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
464,salted green mango,Strangers Parfumerie," salted green mango is utterly unique, and dare we say it, one of strangers parfumerie's best. there are green fragrances, there are sour fragrances, there are dry fragrances -  salted green mango manages to be all of the above, but with an otherworldly, exotic flair that defies description. ostensibly an ode to bao mango, a green, tart mango native to the  southern part of thailand, where perfumer prin lomros was born and raised, there is nothing really sweet or juicy about the fruit note here. instead, the mango is a thing of rare, desiccated beauty - a dark green rind dipped in sea salt that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth only to think of it.why would this be refreshing or appetizing? we don't know, but it just is. salted green mango is a green fruit devoid of sweetness, moisture, or sparkle  instead, it draws us into the shadows of a mineral vetiver and the pleasant bitterness of inedible fruit that is all rind and pith. salted green mango is the crawlspace where we find the coolness and repose we crave in the hottest of weather."," green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

466,aroon sawat,Strangers Parfumerie," aroon sawat, meaninggood morning! in thai, is part of strangers parfumerie's 24/7 series. inspired by the gentle warmth of the morning sun, the scent was composed by perfumer prin lomros with the specific intent of capturing all the golden tones implied in the country's original name of siam, which is thought to have originated in the word suvannaphumi, meaning land of gold.and indeed, aroon sawat is a perfume rich in warm, ambered notes that seem to shimmer like particles of gold dust caught in sunlight. thick, syrupy plums, mango, and ripe passionfruit are suspended in multiple layers of hazy woods, ambers, and resins for a smoky incense effect that lingers all day. think plumes of rich myrrh and sandalwood incense pouring out of an ancient thai temple and mingling with the heady scent of ripe stone fruits and white flowers in nearby orchards. yet, in the midst of all these rich, smoky aromas, there is a thread of freshness  from the citrus, or the sour mango  that cuts through the velveteen texture of the scent and allows air to circulate. it's divine. and if you love woody-ambery-leathery scents such as costume national or ombre indigo (or even chambre noir) by olfactive studio, then aroon sawat could scratch the same itch."," golden mango, marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
467,burning ben,Strangers Parfumerie," burning ben belongs to prin lomros' lgbtq series, and was inspired by a subtle moment in the south korean movie   ""burning where theben character struggles with a conversation that might be interpreted as homophobic, dredging up a host of complex feelings in himself. burning ben is a stunning phenolic scent that similarly unites all sorts of opposing elements  hazelnut, beeswax, burning tires, leather, and forest fruit  creating a surprisingly harmonious andcomplete whole, just like the conflicted humanity of ben.burning ben opens with a hugely realistic shot of espresso, with the dark, roasted flavor of beans brought perhaps a hair too far to burning point. doused in a black, almost chewy sweet, spicy smoke, it feels like walking through the aftermath of a fire. but fear not, for the smoke clears and lifts in places, revealing intriguing hints of nuts, berries, saffron, and plums, notes that lend the austere smoke a gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness. a caramelized-butter amber, incense, and beeswax tandem shore all of this up from the basenotes, for a complex and rich finish that dawdles pleasurably between sweet, smoky, spicy, and sandalwoody without alighting completely on one or the other. if you love phenolic scents such as the black knight by francesca bianchi or t-rex by zoologist but want something softer and subtler for daytime wear, then burning ben could be for you."," hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, javanol, saffron, burning tire",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
468,cigar rum intense,Strangers Parfumerie," if you loved the original cigar rum but longed for more heft, more richness....more everything  then the extrait version, cigar rum intense, is for you. sculpting the original's bright, punchy booze-and-tobacco into a new and more mature direction, cigar rum intense leans on a dark, resinous coffee absolute, a dash of cinnamon, and a strong  aquatic note to mark itself out as a different animal. compared to its predecessor, cigar rum intense is altogether a more muscular affair, an injection of briny radiance lifting and hoisting the richly spicy tobacco, booze, and dried fruit accords over the last mile. it lasts forever. surprisingly, cigar rum intense also smells fresher; a rugged, outdoorsy version of the casual island bar vibe of the original. in the far drydown, a gorgeously silky, masculine-leaning musk emerges, shot thrown by the spicy bay rum' bitterness of copaiba, a greenish-gold tree resin native to brazil. while cigar rum is for the young buck, let's say that cigar rum intense is for the man (or woman) who has arrived at the top and isn't afraid to signal it."," raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
469,oliver,Strangers Parfumerie," oliver is an original take on the aromatic herbs and citrus freshness of the traditional eau de cologne. at first, you smell the bright, tart (and always oddly dry) burst of citrus notes of the classic farina or 4177, with their cleansing and pure aroma designed by nature to awaken and refresh the senses, supported by the crisp, herbal undergrowth of basil leaf, clary sage, and cool, green cypresses. but as the more volatile aromatic notes burn off, you notice some subtly non-traditional notes in the background. there is the musky scent of a man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly from his warm body, introducing a beautifully intimate and human tone (we suspect the glowy magic of ambrette seed and ambergris to be the responsible parties here). then there is the exciting tang of sea salt, the dry rosy leather of quince, the incensey bitterness of oakmoss, and the powdered plushness of triple-milled french iris soap. oliver feels personal. it's far more evolved than it ought to be, for all its eau de cologne inspiration. it makes sense to us that this raspy, oddball freshie was inspired by the bittersweet love story of two young men on the cusp between childhood and adulthood in the acclaimed indie movie call me by your name."," bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
470,lumberjack cologne,Strangers Parfumerie," lumberjack cologne smells exactly as advertized  a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a north american lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. as he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. there is a flash of bitter citrus and scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. lumberjack cologne just smells great  a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. nothing more, nothing less. sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. and that is what lumberjack cologne is."," lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
471,sangre dulce,Strangers Parfumerie," sangre dulce is a weird and yet completely wearable gourmand idea born out of prin lomros' love for two specific movies. the sangre' part of the title, meaning blood (or family ties), represents the crazy lifestyle and mores of the strange religious cult in alejandro jodorowsky's santa sangre, and the dulce' part (sweet) comes from the lurid hallucinations experienced by party goers upon ingesting a cocktail laced with lsd  in the french movie ""climax"" by gaspar noã©. based on the inspiration, we expect an oddball mixture of sweet and inedible elements that have been thrown together in a somewhat wild and unconventional manner. and that is exactly what we get! a wild pinprick burst of woodland strawberries, technicolor in their juicy sweetness, imploding over and over again in a beescomb, their pulpy scent muffled by a molten pour of pure gold honey. but there is also a softly musky tobacco-ish accord, shot through with rosewater marshmallow fluff, and buttery ylang sharpened to a spike with blood orange. it is both sweet and not sweet, edible and firmly inedible, all at once. the balance here is superb, refining a cornucopia of fruits, burnt sugar, and balsams to a slim and elegant peak that is unusual in the gourmand genre. consider us astonished and delighted!"," sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang ylang, benzoin, peru balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
472,mandarava,Parfum Prissana," inspired by the vision of sweet yellow flowers, white elephants, and towering mountain peaks that make up the thai vision of trayastrimsa  the buddhist nirvana or afterlife - mandarava is perfumer prin lomros' interpretation of what heaven smells like. at first, heaven smells like a lei of heady tropical flowers laid around your neck, the lushness of ripe jasmine, rice pudding-esque champaca, and buttery, banana-rich ylang sending the senses reeling. there is an impression of red fruit swollen with juices, threatening to burst out of the pollen-soaked flowers and run down your arm uninterrupted. but this is no innocent, girlish affair. mandarava shows us that flowers can be downright filthy when they want to be. the lasciviousness of the hindi oud couples furiously with a sharp civet and earthy cumin to lend the floral bouquet a spicy animalic edge that seems lifted out of 1980s powerhouse canon, before the reformulation bug bit. now envisage this dense, spicy floral knot being lifted and diffused by a clean, powdery nag champa musk and soft incense ash, wafting in and out of the animalic floral oud notes to breathe air into the composition. after smelling both ma nishtana and mandarava, we are calling prin lomros the master of the eastern incense theme in perfumery, hands down."," bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, himalayan champaca, madagascar ylang ylang, indian marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, mysore sandalwood, assamese oud (hindi), indonesian patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, siamese benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
473,ma nishtana,Parfum Prissana," ma nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of had gadya (the chava alberstein version). in a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask,why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?. after all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. well, ma nishtana is something special.standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of comme des garcons' avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of grimoire by anatole lebreton, ma nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. instead, it is both, all at once. its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. there is incense  mixed incense resins rather than any single one  smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of buddhist temple'-like mysticism. but there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. austerity balanced by comfort. if you're on an incense quest, then ma nishtana might just be your final destination."," saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, norlimbanol, clove, allspice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
474,thichila,Parfum Prissana," thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic thai herbs and spices. either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm.  the composition of thichila is a marvel. although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of wan sao lhong - a traditional thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. an unctuous combo of champaca flower and indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. but blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that siam oud. in thai folklore, wan sao lhong is feted as a love potion. and while thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted  drunk on this thai love potion."," saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, indian tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, thai oud, mysore sandalwood, indonesian vetiver, cinnamon bark, wan sao lhong ( amomum biflorum jack)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
475,mohragot,Parfum Prissana," mohragot, meaningemerald in thai, is an aromatic, muscular masculine that draws on the classical european fougã¨re for structure but twists it in a distinctly eastern direction for a scent that will surprise and delight even the most jaded of palates. exotic touches such as earthy betel leaf, milky-green-sweet pandan leaf, and dusty, tobacco-ish chalood bark  all materials indigenous to south east asian countries such as thailand and india  make it clear that, although we can smell the inky bitterness of oakmoss and the dark green herbal undergrowth of the classic european forest shifting underneath, we are in unfamiliar territory. and it's a thrilling realization.thus, in the place of dewy ferns and bright lavender, we smell the damp, reddish soil of the thai jungle, which mingles with the chewy, green perfumeyness of sweet pandan leaves to create a deeply green, spicy aroma that soothes and excites all at once. in the base, thai oud joins with a flinty, minty oakmoss and the coumarin-like nuances of chalood bark for a finish that is softly musky and woodsy, gently disengaging the scent from its aromatic topnotes. for those who love the classical fougã¨re genre but wish it were a bit more innovative or exotic, mohragot should be on your test list."," betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, thai oud, sandalwood, thai vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
476,tiwa,Parfum Prissana," tiwa, thai fordaytime, is a radiant floral citrus scent that representsthe scents of home for perfumer prin lomros, conjuring up the aromatic, fresh scent of local herbs being simmered in a pot by neighbors, nearby citrus orchards, and the lingering smoke of precious woods being dried in sheds. tiwa belongs to the thammachatr (thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.tiwa is a beautifully fresh, herbal take on the traditional citrus eau de cologne idea. the herbs in the opening are undeniably exotic, with a mouthwateringly savory, minty thai basil duking it out with sour kaffir lime, spicy finger root oil, and an earthy green celery seed. the bright, tart citrus notes play second fiddle to the herbs for a while, but eventually jostle their way to the front, for an effect that is akin to diorella or eau sauvage covered in verdant thai foliage. the herbaciousness dies back eventually to reveal a rich, soapy orange blossom freshness that lingers on the skin for hours, like the warmth of a late afternoon sun. fresh, tart, and rich, tiwa is an upgrade on the eau de cologne theme that you'd be crazy to miss out on.made with 100% natural materials"," tangerine, kaffir limes, orange flower absolute, petitgrain, holy basil, cananga, finger root oil, indonesian patchouli, guava leaf, lime, celery seed, vetiver, australian sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

498,meraki,Fort & Manle," meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, shisedo's long discontinued nombre noir. envisioned as the japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary serge lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. but a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than luca turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""when creating meraki, rasei fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of nombre noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. however, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. it's a tribute to what nombre noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.and so this is the journey to meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable fort & manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. it's a perfect rasei fort creation, in other words. and given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to nombre noir in every way."," aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

508,le pavillon dor,Dusita," le pavillon d'or by parfums dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for thai-born perfumer, pissara umavijani. first and foremost, it draws on the sun moon lake in taiwan, where her father, the poet montri umavijani (1941-2006), wrotea wish, a poem that reads:will i ever have a chance/to sleep by the river of love/look on the mountain of long life/and dip my vision in sun moon lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinement. but pissara was also inspired by her love for guerlã©dan lake in brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the aisawan triphya-art pavilion in thailand, a stupendous piece of thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of le pavillon d'or. le pavillon d'or is constructed as intricately as a thai floating pavilion itself. opening with the crisp, green chill of orris root and mint, the perfume feels immediately cooling; a hot brow soothed by splashes from a mountain stream. the peppery, citrusy nuances of the wild mentha citrata give the opening a fresh, almost classical feel. soon after, an astonishing fig leaf accord moves into place, managing somehow to be both juicy and dry at the same time. notes of sweet honeysuckle, boronia, white thyme, and somalian frankincense render the fig leaf far more interesting than it oughtta be, with tendrils of sweet florals, smoky, and resinous herbal accents creating a heady-but-light whorl of scent. underneath this all, a divine sandalwood dressed up with a complex, 30-note heliotrope accord give the scent a luxuriantly creamy, almondy base to bed it all down. both aromatic and warm, le pavillon d'or is a clever series of contrasts wrapped up in a bottle. we think it's as delicately beautiful as the trio of lakes that inspired it."," mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

512,corpse reviver,Bruno Fazzolari," in 2016, bruno fazzolari and bogue's antonio gardoni released cadavre exquis, a playful and exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents through a sort of olfactory game of telephone. featuring a striking dark chocolate note atop vintage-feeling aromatic florals, boozy fruit, and a potent dose of animalics, it was a monster of a scent- one that challenged- and rewarded- those off-kilter enough to get on its level. now, with corpse reviver, bruno fazzolari has brought the spirit of cadavre exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together. and we must confess, it works perfectly- now, the rich, earthy indulgence of the dark chocolate springs more naturally from the juicy, boozy opening, while the animalics and spicy florals recede slightly in favor of the aromatics, allowing the composition to breathe and evolve. in the mood for a wholly unique, sophisticated gourmand with real artistic flair? don't miss corpse reviver."," blood orange, camphor, whiskey, rosemary, marigold, dried fruit, anise, cypress, dark chocolate, vanilla, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
513,elysium  cologne,Roja Parfums," elysium pour homme parfum cologne is the original elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. forming part of roja dove's ""parfum cologne"" collection - a new category invented by roja dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an edp concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - elysium pour homme parfum cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long.  the original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the parfum cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. the fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet elysium pour homme parfum cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. this parfum cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. if you'd like aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder bleu de chanel, then step into the glorious elysian fields that is the elysium pour homme parfum cologne experience."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
514,creatione  cologne,Roja Parfums," roja's much loved creation-e, or enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of london's saville row tailors. but maybe  just maybe  you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though roja would probably argue with us on that one). if you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart  roja dove has heard you. creation-e parfum cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather.  the warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. you still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but creation-e parfum cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!"," bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
515,danger  cologne,Roja Parfums," a super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougã¨re with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, danger pour homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via roja dove's  ""parfum cologne"" collection - a new category invented by roja dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an edp concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. danger pour homme parfum cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new parfum cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. this alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics  lavender, tarragon, and bergamot  and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. danger pour homme parfum cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
516,scandal  cologne,Roja Parfums," if the original scandal pour homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougã¨re on steroids (think eau sauvage to the nth degree), then the parfum cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately  the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. the original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the parfum cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.  but make no bones about it  the brighter cologne'-like freshness does not mean a drop in performance metrics. operating at an eau de parfum concentration of 20%, scandal pour homme parfum cologne is still a rich, solidly classical fougã¨re that will keep you smelling like a belgravia square gentleman through to the end of the day. if you love the minty, herbal freshness of traditional barbershop scents and deplore the sweetness of modern masculines, then you'll love scandal pour homme parfum cologne's return to form."," lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, spearmint, lavender, basil, tarragon, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, violet, rhubarb, cardamom, clove, nutmeg, moss, patchouli, vetiver, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, labdanum, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
517,vetiver  cologne,Roja Parfums," with its new iteration as a parfum cologne - a new category invented by roja dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an edp concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne  roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his vetiver par excellence. indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. but vetiver parfum cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. or maybe don't choose at all -  get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! in other words, worry not. what we love the most about roja's vetiver  its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness  has been transposed wholesale here into the parfum cologne."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

521,vetiver nocturne autumn 19,Bortnikoff," if you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. this note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. this is especially true when it comes to the precious indian 25-year-old vetiver oil ruh khus, which forms the heart of vã©tiver nocturne. in order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young ruh khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. the base of the composition consists of the oils of indonesian sandalwood and oud trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of white champaca and thai jasmine. floral notes revealed the beauty of sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. only the real mysore sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. it's hard to imagine a better framing for the vetiver note than this.autumn '19 edition: new ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release. you may find the autumn '19 edition even better..."," bergamot, neroli, frangipani, cardamom, champaca, champaca leaf, jasmine, oakmoss, vetiver, ruh khus, myrrh, sandal 100k, indian sandalwood, sandal infusion (thai jasmine & white champaca), oud trat, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

523,female christ,19-69," on 29 may 1969, a naked woman carrying a cross walked through the copenhagen stock exchange- an iconic piece of performance art carried out by danish artists lene adler petersen and bjã¸rn norgaard that gripped the culture with its transgressive nature and exploration of religion, eroticism, and capitalism. however, as with so much of the genre-defying protest art of the '60s, only a photograph remains to commemorate the accomplishment. by introducing female christ the fragrance, a powerful, thoughtful, and deeply sensual blend of patchouli and resin, 19-69 preserves the essence of the art piece for the next generation to discover and learn. female christ is, first and foremost, a patchouli scent- rich, earthy, velvety, warm. invigorating currents of spicy and herbaceous aromatics- eucalyptus, thyme, pimento- keep a bright liveliness in the foreground, while juicy rhubarb and berries add a sweet, fresh balance to the earthiness. as it dries, a sexy, provocative benzoin combines with dashes of vanilla and ambergris to transport the ever-present patchouli from the '60s milieu into something more transcendently contemporary, asserting the lasting significance of the piece that inspired the scent. 19-69 have already proven themselves masters of stylish, provocative patchouli scents- with female christ, they have raised the bar yet again."," eucalyptus, patchouli, pimento, rhubarb, thyme, geranium, berries, vanilla, ambergris, benzoin, cinnamon, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

527,chypresiam,Rogue Perfumery," chypre-siam is a joyful middle finger to ifra. unrepentedly teeming with enough oakmoss to make an eu official faint, this is a fragrance that lays lie to the notion that they just don't make em like they used to anymore.' with chypre-siam, manuel cross proves for once and for all that it's not only possible make an authentic chypre in this day and age, but that it's possible to do it so well that it sounds like a battle cry. but if all cross were to do is mix oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin together, it would be dull and derivative. instead, chypre-siam has been designed as an irreverent south east asian' take on the classic chypre, with a tart kaffir lime topnote replacing the traditional bergamot, and thai holy basil to underline the minty bitterness of that oakmoss underpinning. its raunchy, civet-inflected leather accord lends a lascivious purr that feels like labdanum ramped up beyond its normal range. and yet, despite the heavy-sounding notes, chypre-siam retains a fresh, translucent greenness all the way through  even the jasmine here smells more like violets in woodland than sultry white flowers. a warm, powdery trail lingers after the fireworks of the kaffir lime, oakmoss, and leather die down, the siamese benzoin a sly nod to the south-east asian inspiration for chypre-siam. finally, a chypre that feels, smells, and actually is authentic."," oakmoss, kaffir lime, civet, jasmine, ylang, leather, spices, holy basil, sandalwood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
528,tabac vert,Rogue Perfumery," tabac vert is a gentle tobacco breeze blowing in from the past, when tobacco-focused fragrance compositions were not sweetened with vanilla or tonka bean. with references to vintage tabarome and krizia moods, tabac vert presents us with a gentlemanly vision of what tobacco can smell like when played with a subtle hand.the tobacco leaf in tabac vert is green and unsmoked - not yet 100% dry - and therefore has none of that ambery, dried fruit sweetness we are used to in modern tobacco scents. the main supporting character here is a dusty, spicy carnation that adds a slightly vintage feel. however, remarkably, nothing about this scent reads as dated. a peppery sandalwood and a fine dusting of subtle florals  rose and jasmine  give the tobacco-carnation heart a soft roundness that's comforting without being particularly sweet. although the references here are all to great tobacco masculines of the past, we can't help but feel that a woman could totally rock this too."," tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
529,mousse illuminee,Rogue Perfumery," mousse illuminã©e is a delightful anachronism. it smells manly in the best possible way  soapy, bright, and almost cleansing in its bitterness, a cornucopia of camphoraceous green notes such as cypress, laurel, and artemisia stuffed into a cedar chest, aromatizing it from the inside out. fougã¨res used to smell like this, once upon a time, we remember. now, shorn of any vanilla or sweetness, mouse illuminã©e returns the fougã¨re to its original form, stripping it back until we are left with a powerful and invigorating forest fern' accord that is unabashedly masculine.the deeply green atmosphere created by mousse illuminã©e revolves around a beautiful treemoss absolute from robertet, but it is by no means the sole player. in particular, the minty laurel and camphoraceous aspects of the cypress and artemisia stand out, framed by an aquiline frankincense note that smells lightly smoky, but not burnt or severe. best of all, there's no softening or fussiness towards the middle - a muscular musk simply carries the greenery on its broad shoulders to its natural conclusion."," treemoss, frankincense, green cypress, artemisia, laurel, cedar, white floral notes, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
530,40 rogue,Rogue Perfumery," 40 rogue is a recreation of the long-discontinued 40 love by jean desprez, a fragrance that was apparently an interesting cross between an animalic, 1970s-style musk and a fougã¨re. given the opportunity to smell a vial of this forgotten gem, manuel cross decided that it wassimply too good to lose to the mists of time, and so here we are!fragrance fans not used to vintage perfume, or even vintage-style perfume, may want to adjust their television sets. 40 rogue initially smells very vintage, with a burst of hairspray-ish aldehydes, wax-coated fruit, and a dusty carnation setting the scene in a pre-war diner in paris, its spine straight and hair coiffed to an inch of its life. but this rich, formal air relaxes quickly, loosening its stays to let in gusts of aromatic, sunburnt herbs, lemon, and creamy, animalic musks that recall a fresher jicky or even a jazzed-up jovan's musk (original 1970s formula). fuzzy fruit, moss, and hay-like narcissus folded into a barbershoppy musk  what's not to like here?"," citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
531,derviche,Rogue Perfumery," the brief manuel cross set himself for derviche was simple  honor the famously soft green, powdery vanilla of vintage emeraude by coty but give it the power of one of those ambers coming out of the middle-eastern houses. in the end, derviche smells very little like emeraude but somehow features the same idea, which is to say a perfect balance struck between the tartness of citrus and the creamy sweetness of amber.at heart, derviche is really all about hookah. the tobacco accord here is incredibly rich, with dried cherry facets that will make you think of revani, a turkish semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup so sweet it's almost sharp. unlike ambre narguilã© by hermes, which derviche resembles slightly, the ambery tobacco has a little animalic kick in its tail to keep things interesting. civet and saffron act together to form a dry, slightly funky animal leather accord, while ambergris gives the dry-down a salty-sweet muskiness that's entrancing. if you love those big, insanely comforting old school balsamic ambers or tobaccos, then give this derviche a whirl."," bergamot, labdanum, vanilla, jasmine, olibanum, sandalwood, musk, tobacco leaf, leather, saffron, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

547,love kills,Masque Milano," while the concept of a soliflore might suggest simpler, more linear scents, one sniff of love kills should quickly disavow you of that notion. instead, caroline dumur has created a rose soliflore with luscious yet edgy depth, one that masterfully plays off of the well known phrase it takes its name from to present both the romantic and dangerous sides of the grand dame of perfume florals.on the ""love"" side of things, the fragrance opens with joyful brightness, using a mouthwateringly juicy lychee note to introduce a sparkling, ambrette-tinted rose oxide. as it blossoms into a full-bodied, romantic turkish rose absolute, we see the darker, more sensual, ""killer"" side of the equation- sultrier floral tones, animalic musk, and a woodsy patchouli distillation with a decidedly...thorny quality. it's a portrait of love in full- the joy, the hope, the intensity, and even the heartbreak, all contained within the multifaceted beauty of a rose."," lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

560,harem soiree,Arte Profumi," a boozy rose dipped in honey and plunged into the salty rawness of ambergris, harem soiree is a stunning attar-like fragrance that takes no prisoners in the floral oriental genre. the ambergris lends a fiercely saline, windswept edge to the ambery underpinnings of the fragrance, joining with a resinous, licorice-like myrrh to render a picture of an unsweet, unpolished chunk of amber resin that has just washed up on a beach somewhere along the baltic coast. the textural contrasts in harem soiree are incredibly satisfying, especially in the juxtaposition of the syrupy, honeyed rose against the rough-edged, salt-and-pepper dryness of the ambergris and myrrh notes. rich in a mouthwateringly sweet-and-savory way that keeps you interested all day long, harem soiree has the additional advantage of being hugely radiant and sillage-aceous - outwitting humidity, showers, or whatever else you can throw at it. to wear harem soiree is to be bathed in your own personal halo of roses, precious resins, and salty ambergris, saturating the air around you in a heavy rose-gold hue. divine."," ambergris, rose, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
561,velvet rouge,Arte Profumi," velvet rouge is not for a perfume for wallflowers. immediately enveloping and rich, it lustfully embraces the bold statement that only coffee beans, licorice, and cacao pods can make when exposed to high heat  a delightfully aromatic, burnt aroma that fans of both borneo 1838 by serge lutens and coze by parfumerie generale will adore. despite its cocoa-dusted opening, however, velvet rouge steers well away from the gourmand elements of its dark materials, choosing instead to chase the cocoa down with a hit of bright, spicy chili pepper and a dusting of nutmeg. with a rooty, slightly dirty-grungy vetiver and what smells to us like a ton of sooty frankincense bringing up the rear instead of the usual vanilla or amber, velvet noir retains its slightly austere, mysterious character throughout. it finishes out on an unusual accent of smoked-out licorice. a scent full of shadows and secrets, velvet rouge is perfect for those of few words and un-guessed-at depths."," cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
562,bois sacre,Arte Profumi," bois sacre, or sacred wood, is an artistic rendering of the yin and yang character of two of the most precious woods in the world, namely indian oud and sandalwood. cleverly playing the animalic, leathery sourness of indian oud off against the buttery, aromatic dryness of indian sandalwood, the result is a scent that is exuberantly rich and full-flavored but not in the slightest bit heavy. the medley of woods here seems to shimmer in the air like the red dust over a north african desert. if the woods are remarkably airy, the doughy, treacly resinousness of labdanum moves quickly into place underneath to ground them. growing ever drier and leatherier over time, we love how the labdanum lends an earthy, resinous heft that acts as a center of balance for the scent without ever drowning the woods in the buttery sweetness of vanilla. there's even a dusty hot paper' note in the drydown that makes us think of benzoin, even though none is listed. dry but rich, this is the perfect woody oriental for cold weather."," agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
563,samharam,Arte Profumi," samharam is a rich incense scent that traces a straight line to the ancient aromas of myrrh and benzoin that would have accompanied the caravan traders that moved from across the deserts from the spice and resin markets of somalia and oman to venice and beyond. opening with a triumphantly coca cola-ish myrrh with smoky licorice overtones, samharam rolls on like a stone, picking up the deeply sooty nuances of somali frankincense and elemi, as well as the sweeter hot brown paper' powderiness of benzoin. samharam smells both sacred and profane, the ethereal high church' lift of the incense raising our thoughts up to the heavens, while all the time enticing our more gustatory senses with a pleasing bite of black pepper and a slightly salty amber. although not foody in the slightest, there's something piquant in this incense accord that pricks the saliva glands and makes our bellies growl. incredibly full-figured and rich, as all arte profumi fragrances are, samharam is the old world italian artisanal response to the thin and bony incense scents of modern lore."," myrrh, incense, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
564,sucre noir,Arte Profumi," sucre noir deserves the same holy grail status granted by vanilla lovers to tihota by indult or vaniglia by mazzolari. one of the most luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled, it is the olfactory equivalent of being wrapped up in the purest, whitest' cashmere blanket that costs  more than most of us earn in a month. there's a luxury in its simplicity, because there's nowhere for any mistakes to hide. recalling nothing more than the nostalgic goodness of white sugar infused with the sultry warmth of a vanilla bean or two, and perhaps a breath of cocoa-dusted vanilla orchid, it is the sort of  vanilla we loved first while learning about taste and smell  that pure white' sort of sweetness as of yet unsullied by smoke, musk, or resin. the cane sugar is the perfect final touch, its slightly burnt, brown sugar aroma adding an interesting caramelization that creates depth but not shade. vanilla lovers  we are putting you on notice!"," orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
565,oeilleres,Roberto Greco,"i want to echo the flowers i photograph without referring to any one in particular. therefore, along with marc-antoine corticchiato, we decided to exclude rose, jasmine and all the overly tangible flowers. we managed to express the general idea of floralcy through the dried flower, pollen and honey facets of chamomile and broom. to connect the scent with the figures i photograph, i also wanted to convey the feel of flesh. in order to achieve this, we brought out the animal aspects of vegetal notes, as well as various spices and resins.  though it wasn't an end in itself, the fragrance is bursting with natural ingredients  sometimes in very high doses, all the better to express the organic duality of my images. between the delicacy of a fading petal and the radicality of a fold of skin.  roberto grecoåillã¨res - l'objet parfumant is the anti-flower fragrance, a truly rare, beautiful creation. produced in limited edition of 500 pieces worldwide."," eucalyptus, broom, chamomile, lavender, cumin, incense, hay, musk, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/835000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

569,la couche du diable,Serge Lutens," la couche du diable (we'll choose to forego some of the raunchier translations and simply call it ""the devil's bed"") was bound to cause a fuss- after all, throughout his many releases, serge lutens has never before featured oud in a fragrance. but with that in mind, don't expect anything resembling a typical oud scent. oh, there's an unmistakably high-quality oud in here- darkly woodsy, warm, and sweetly balsamic- but its more challengingly animalic tones are, if not subverted, at least channeled into resinous cistus and syrupy fruit-and-rose combination that incite a sense of deep, seductive comfort. serge lutens' own copy describes la couche du diable as ""a diabolical and sumptuous veil of indulgence and remorse for a first transgression."" we'd agree, up to a certain point- but if we're being honest, when it comes to this stunning fragrance- remorse doesn't even cross our mind."," oud accord, cistus jam, fruity complex, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36169.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

626,megamare,Orto Parisi," a portrait of the beauty that lies on the surface of the ocean, and the dangers of the salty depths below. megamare is a swirling typhoon of a scent, a heady wash of brackish water, biting green algae, spicy-sweet sea air, and a sparkling musk that radiates with the intensity of the midday sun reflecting off the rolling waves of the open ocean. with immense longevity and powerful projection. tranquil and terrifying, serene and sensual, megamare radiates the yin and yang of the sea.","spicy, sweet, sparkling musk, oceany",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
627,mahabah,ANFAS," mahaba, meaninglove but alsocharity in arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. a bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. in the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends un bois vanille (serge lutens) its mysterious darkness. later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. feminine, lovely, and unusual, mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing."," petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
628,shaghaf,ANFAS," shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the anfas crown. the simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis  a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business  in the heart of a middle eastern city. shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. the spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. but soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. slowly, a worn leather note emerges  or maybe it is black tea  thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the middle east to smell like. but for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. with its toasty, sandy texture, shaghaf occupies the same headspace as fidelis (by histoires de parfum), nanban (arquiste), and songe d'un bois en etã© (guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. with the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. color us impressed  this bad boy is a muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it."," cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
629,red ishq,ANFAS,"i cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and i cannot express my love for you. you are me, i move with you. red ishq is perfumer asim al qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron  dry, slightly bitter  is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. think tuscan leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. the drydown of red ishq features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of encens flamboyant (annick goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of baccarat rouge (maison francis kurkdijan). despite the pert raspberry note up front, red ishq is completely unisex  a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water."," jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
630,green gaya,ANFAS," bright, fresh, and unashamedly cheerful, green gaya whisks us on a journey to a true oasis, where its bounty of succulent fruit and spicy woods is all the richer for the vastness of the desert that surrounds it. picture an exotic dessert, created from the ripest, juiciest fruits a kingdom could produce- sticky, mouthwatering mango and plump, smooth, gently floral pear, enhanced with a daring dose of sweet cardamom and rich star anise. a delectably creamy milk heart heightens the gourmand delicacy, while a balancing accord of crisp, stout cedarwood and a gentle touch of oud cut through the sweet and creamy notes to provide energy and structure. a warm amber base paired with dry iris suggests the stifling heat just outside of our hideaway, heightening the contrast and enhancing the refreshing vitality."," anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
631,purple sakan,ANFAS," purple sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. it is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. but as purple sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. purple sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of asim al qassim's emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal."," bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
632,gold watan,ANFAS," ""a story written with golden water... a history that cannot be erased...""inspired by the feeling of pure luxury conveyed by both pure gold and pure oud, gold watan is a shimmering vision of romance and exoticism. from the first spray, its royal lineage is clear, as the top notes feature a rich, resinous, potent oud and cistus combination usually reserved for a scent's latter phases. in this instance, however, it proves the perfect introduction- powerfully evocative, yet so well balanced that the subtly sweet and smoky tones have room to shift and move, leading into an exuberant heart of woodsy, spicy nagarmotha and a smooth, multi-colored floral accord that adds softness to the oud's pungent authenticity. pillowy musk and the perfect amount of mouthwatering, crystalline sugar complete the intriguingly parallel evolution of the scent, as the progression from rugged to refined happens with such designed subtlety that you may not realize quite what's happened until you find that you simply cannot stop sniffing your wrist. sumptuous and authentic, yet delicious and delightful, gold watan is an unforgettable oud fragrance."," cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
633,rahaba,ANFAS," rahaba is the arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. in arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously  and rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. it opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. a fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. there is a touch of gin, too  but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. this barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. however, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find rahaba tremendously inviting. the bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. the drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. rahaba is, in its final hours, a mã©lange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk  perhaps ambrox  that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy."," orange, gin, pineapple, damask rose, grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
634,samaha,ANFAS," samaha, meaning tolerance and magnanimity in arabic, is a modern venus on a half shell. picture a bosomy bouquet of freshly-cut flowers emerging from a fine misting of sea spray, and then wrapped in a cloud of soapy floral musks and the steamy vapors of feminine bathing rituals. like its antecedents, amouage gold or madame rochas, samaha is a classically feminine scent that manages to be refined and faintly suggestive at the same time. flirting with the line between freshly-scrubbed and richly suggestive, it channels the classic triad of grasse-grown jasmine, rose, and neroli through the red velvet corridor of a parisian boudoir. there are no aldehydes here, nothing fusty or old-fashioned, and yet its perfumey cloud of abstract flowers and bathroomy musks clearly draws on a french tradition of perfumery. the key difference is the salty, lemony radiance that suffuses the structure with air and light  samaha is full-bodied, but light, like the fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake you can imagine."," citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
635,saadah,ANFAS," sa'adah is an arabic name for girls that means happiness'. and indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. we see sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. crucially, though, sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to age' it. it is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. a warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. a happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal."," orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
636,velvet splendour perfume concentrate,Goldfield & Banks," we absolutely adore mimosa-based scents, so when word arrived that the newest goldfield & banks would feature golden wattle, or australian mimosa, we were delighted. but what we never could have anticipated is just how uniquely different from european mimosa golden wattle turns out to be- powdery and woodsy, with gentle tones of green fruit, this is a hearty and distinctive floral note all its own- one that truly captures the rugged beauty of the flinders ranges in southern australia where the wattle used in this fragrance is harvested. as goldfield & banks is so adept at accomplishing, every supplemental ingredient in this cheerfully complex floral brings out a new aspect of the golden wattle- bright, fresh mandarin, smooth orange blossom and jasmine, and soft, gently earthy woods produce a refined naturalism. if you're a mimosa lover looking for something you've never quite tried before, or if you're simply seeking a gorgeous and unique floral perfect for any occasion, velvet splendour is ray of warm sunshine."," mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute (south australia), orange blossom, jasmin sambac, australian sandalwood, patchouli, haitian vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
637,papyrus oud,Parle Moi de Parfum," in 2003, michel almairac released the instantly iconic gucci pour homme, a boldly warm and woodsy men's scent featuring a proprietary ""papyrus wood"" accord that defied the fresh, synthetic trends of the time to become a modern classic. now, almost two decades later, almairac returns to his beloved creation through a niche fragrance lens- with an emphasis on smoky, spicy complexity- and the result is papyrus oud, a vision of masculine elegance and warm sophistication.the key to papyrus oud's timeless appeal is evident in the east-meets-west nature of its composition, with classically french floral and aromatic notes of lavender, geranium, oakmoss and jasmine injecting vibrant elegance into the luxuriously middle eastern melange of fiery spice, papyrus, agarwood, and incense. the result is a scent that feels full but never heavy, distinctive but smooth and surprisingly easy to wear- a true signature scent that, while leaning masculine, smells out-of-this-world good on just about anyone. whether you've long missed gucci pour homme or are simply looking for something that casts aside the trends of the day for something better, papyrus oud is a gift from above."," papyrus, incense, patchouli, oud, musk, chocolate, ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
638,gardens of india,Parle Moi de Parfum," some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. it's this latter philosophy that guides gardens of india, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. as basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of gardens of india is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer michel almairac spent refining the formula. it begins with jasmine buds, plucked in june and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. the scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. take a walk through the gardens of india- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there."," jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

667,douce amere,Serge Lutens," devilishly bitter, then divinely sweet  this eccentric brew is a bundle of contradictions from the moment it touches your skin. the absinthe is cool and the cinnamon is hot. the flowers are ethereal and the wood is strong. the licorice is sharp and the powder is soft and it all melds together in an indescribable way that will having you sneaking off to sniff your arm again and again. moody and contrary, this is the unexpected lightness of heart at the sight of a gray, rainy day; the decadent thrill of reveling in a bad mood overlong; the sharp stab of melancholy when you hear of someone else being happy. this is dark and troubled and enigmatic, even through the sweetest parts, and at the heart of it all is the aromatic artemisia absinthum, almost medicinal at first but becoming a warm and glowing narcotic presence as the elixir develops. edgy and fiendishly attractive, this is the perfect scent to wear when you are looking for trouble. actually, if you wear it, trouble will probably find you first."," absinthe (artemisia absinthum) , cinnamon, anise, lily, jasmine, tiare, tagette, marigold, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
668,rahat loukhoum,Serge Lutens," not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in rome. if you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. it's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.and so it is with rahat loukoum. the sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. the base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible. rahat loukoum is that rare scent is that is far from your average gourmand-- though with serge lutens' pedigree, we're guessing you already knew that. please note that palais royal collection bell jars are splash bottles"," aldehydes, almond, cherry, hawthorn, rose, heliotrope, white honey, vanilla, tonka bean, balsam, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36157.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
669,iris silver mist,Serge Lutens," more iris, more, more, more, serge lutens famously urged maurice roucel when he was composing iris silver mist. legend has it that poor maurice went back to the lab and, in his desperation, threw every known iris material into the formula, including a little-used iris nitrile called irival. what emerged chrysalis-like from this chaotic lab experiment was a wonder of nature and a work of art.iris silver mist smells entirely like a root freshly torn from the ground, caked with earth, dew, and ice. its purity is lung-filling and green - as bracing as cold water running in a brook. between the iced, milky roots of the topnotes and the cool musk in the base, clove and benzoin lend the texture a spicy, dusty feel that almost approaches human warmth. but make no mistake  iris silver mist is as brutally pure as a block of ice melting slowly in a forest on the russian steppes. as close to wearing a piece of art as you're likely to get. please note that palais royal collection bell jars are splash bottles"," orris root, galbanum, sandalwood, cedar, clove, vetiver, musk, benzoin, incense, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36158.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
670,bois et musc,Serge Lutens," ahh, bois et musc! we have a particular fondness for this unfairly overlooked gem in the lutens bois series, which wears like a sunset in smudgy golds and pinks. bois et musc is a soft, rosy cedarwood diffused out into a cloud of musk and sweetened with a judicious touch of spice (the notes say saffron, but we also smell a gentle nutmeg, cinnamon, and perhaps even a smattering of cumin). far woodier and less syrupy-fruity than its siblings in the bois series  bois de violette and bois et fruits  bois et muscs may actually be closer in spirit to the original shiseido feminitã© du bois than the current serge lutens version.           more than scent, however, bois et musc is all about texture: its musk is velvety and beeswaxy, while its cedarwood is silky. not as dirty as muscs khoublai khan but not nearly as clean as clair de musc, bois et musc is, for us, the happy medium of lutensian musks. it is sensual as hell but in that comfortably discreet way that makes people wonder if you're wearing perfume or just smell particularly good. and when you're wearing bois et musc, you most certainly do. please note that palais royal collection bell jars are splash bottles"," atlas cedarwood, beeswax, saffron, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36167.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
671,sarrasins,Serge Lutens," rich yet airy and clear', sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to la nuit's dense buttercream satin. famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. sarrasins is very elegant and very french - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. in the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. the dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication. wear sarrasins to feel inimitably french.  please note that palais royal collection bell jars are splash bottles"," bergamot, labdanum, carnation, osmanthus, jasmine, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36168.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

676,eau de minthe,Diptyque," invented in 1882 with the release of houbigant's fougere royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine european fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of diptyque. but in case you haven't figured it out from the name, eau de minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss dna of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. as a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, eau de minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, eau de minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats."," mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
677,splendiris,Dusita," with the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? in the case of the truly magical newest release from dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. as the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. a perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. in other words, splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. while we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new dusita release, splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own."," bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
678,rose of no mans land hair perfume,BYREDO," byredo presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. each hair perfume combines one of byredo's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented. rose of no man's land is centered around the delicate petals of a turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. a radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity."," pink pepper, turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
679,malt,Akro," what happens when you cross a peaty laphroaig whiskey with an aquatic? malt. sure, it's the answer to a question we don't remember asking, but we're so happy that such a thing actually exists. opening with a gorgeously caramelized whiskey note that conjures up both the smokiness and the toffee-like depth of an aged whiskey from the highlands of scotland, malt quickly slips into a firmly mid-tone register: rich but light, with toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding it together. this deft lightness of touch is underscored by a minty, anisic tobacco-like note, which the notes say is seaweed. certainly, this note gains in salt and crunch as time wears on, but while it is redolent of the sea, it less the sweet, melony undertone of calone-driven aquatics, and more the naturally green, salty outdoorsy air blowing in off the north sea. wearing malt feels like drinking a glass of peaty scotch with friends at a beach bonfire on a cold october evening, the air infused with salt, heather, and good, old-fashioned bonhomie."," whiskey, rum, leather, seaweed, patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
680,dark,Akro," oh man, this is good. a thick pour of molten dark chocolate to begin with, as strong and as intense as an espresso, but absent any of the metallic or animalic aspects that can sometimes emerge in dark chocolate. this is dark chocolate idealized. it's not sweet or creamy, but there's a strong hint of caramelized milk running underneath the rafters of the scent to pull it back from acridity. it's pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss.throughout the day, as the dark chocolate tonality ebbs away, a gloriously rich, nutty base steps forward to fill the vacuum. spicy, cinnamon-flecked tonka and hazelnut notes combine with vanilla to create a suede-textured drydown that seems to go on forever without shedding any of its richness  a thing of beauty in a world where oftentimes the ending is rushed. interestingly, though from the same hand that created angel, dark is its complete opposite  plush but not fruity, and gourmand but not edible or yummy'. dark is an exquisitely balanced, elegant chocolate quasi-gourmand that leans to the adult side of the indulgence spectrum. an utter pleasure to wear."," cocoa, dark chocolate, cinnamon, hazelnut, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
681,night,Akro," night will make you blush. a finger stroke's worth of cumin imbues an innocently rosy musk with enough inner thigh naughtiness to stop anyone in their track's, retrace their steps, and follow that divine scent to its source: you. night is sexy because it dances on that barely perceptible line between clean and dirty, never tipping its hand too far in one direction or the other, and therefore keeping you guessing all the way through.picture the aftermath of love  sheets tangled, traces of clean sweat and passionate kisses cooling quickly on the pillow. your lover's gone, but everything still smells of them, including your skin and hair. mingling with the scent of love is the fresh smell of the neroli and rose soap you both washed with that morning, and the starchy brightness of just-laundered sheets. the prismatic dance between clean and dirty, fresh and lived-in in night is utterly entrancing; it feels sexy and alive and human."," bulgarian rose, cumin, saffron, agaroud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
682,smoke,Akro," smoking. the ultimate modern taboo. a dirty word. and yet, for those old enough to remember, there is something viscerally pleasing about the acrid aroma of a freshly-lit cigarette  perhaps because all the more attractive for its illicit, banned-in-public places, worse-than-marijuana notoriety it now enjoys. how akro smoke smells to you will depend on your experience with smoking. for reformed smokers, it will smell nostalgic and haunting, a memory of coats, hair, and rooms impregnated with the acrid scent of cigarettes long stubbed out. for the uninitiated, it may smell almost shockingly intense, boasting a range of aromas from rubber and camphor to ash. a smidgen of sweetness from creamy tonka and powdery benzoin in the base is there for support, but in the end, there is nothing sweet or gourmand about this. just a transparent, weightless wash of honest-to-goodness second hand cigarette smoke on the skin; sexy in a grimy, lived-in way that's difficult to explain to anyone who's never indulged. if you love jeke by slumberhouse, but want a summer-sheer version, then smoke should be on your sample list."," balkans tobacco leaves, nicotine, cade, benjoin, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
683,haze,Akro," haze is the aromatic fog of a bohemian cafã©, where the lurid green fairy of absinthe mingles with the sage-bush dryness of an illicit spliff. but surprisingly, before it is all this, it is a whirlwind brush with a kitchen garden after a downpour, a riotous vortex of crushed mint, snapped plant stems, and the herbal dewiness of clary sage. it smells like fresh lavender buds and wet soil, a winning mixture of sun-warmed herbs and the cool dampness of a spring shower. deeply herbal and green, haze slowly starts to dry out to the bittersweet, grassy smokiness that will later define it as a creature of the night. a boozy artemisia note adds that anisic, pernod-like twang that still, years after absinthe was made legal again, feels quite naughty. the impression of marijuana is there, but subtly so, and certainly not enough to get you pulled over by the police. a softly smoky leather accent in the base ties it all together  pulling the scent from bright, wet, sunlit kitchen herbs to poetry reading in a parisian cafã© in one easy, fluid arc. sexy in a casually-tousled way, haze is for those who like fresh and aromatic, but done with an irreverent twist."," absinthe, armoise, eucalyptus, spearmint, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

685,bana banana,L'Artisan Parfumeur," the story of bana banana is, unlikely as this may seem, the story of the creation of l'artisan parfumeur. in the 1970's, chemist and plant collector jean-francois laporte was planning to attend the legendarily exuberant and creative les folies bergeres, and needed to up the ante for his latest look, which was, of course, a banana costume. drawing on his knowledge of natural materials, he created a banana scent for himself, and in the process he discovered a heretofore unknown passion for fragrance made with traditional methods and exceptional raw materials, a calling that would eventually result in his founding of l'artisan parfumeur with the help of master perfumer jean-claude ellena. now, in collaboration with his daughter celine ellena, l'artisan resurrects that legendary scent, reimagined with all the style, skill, and quality for which the brand has become famous. oh, but did we mention how unbelievably fun it is? the banana is rich, green, and fruity, surrounded with lively pepper and savory nutmeg, the floral aspects reinforced with milky jasmine and gently powdered iris and violet to coax the impression of ripe banana skin. warm, tonka-infused amber foregrounds the fruit, lingering like the heat of the sun at dusk. playful yet sophisticated, and rich in both character and history, bana banana is more than just a banana scent- it's the legacy of l'artisan parfumeur in a bottle."," pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
686,easy to love,Eau d'Italie," one thing italians love is an anniversary celebration. and so it's only fitting that the eau d'italie fragrance line, created 15 years ago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the hotel le sireneuse positano, has now begat a celebratory milestone of its own. easy to love, a love letter to fragrance, hospitality, and the stunning beauty of the amalfi coast, more than lives up to its name, wrapping us up in a lovely and soothing blend of fresh florals and juicy fig as seductive and timeless as italy itself. it's a delightful example of quality over complication, with each note playing a vital role- white currant, sweeter than its better-known black and red siblings, still lends a distinctive tart buzz to the creamy, green fig note, made even fresher with a gentle peony. and lest we forget that la dolce vita is as much about sensory pleasures as it is the beauty of nature, easy to love features a luscious base of sweet honey, tonka bean, and subtly sensual ambrette musk- a nod to the food, drink, and romance one almost can't help but experience on the mediterranean. if 15 years of eau d'italie resulted in a scent this carefree and wonderful, we can't wait to see what milestones we'll be celebrating next."," white currant, fig, white peony, honey, tonka, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43237.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
687,cassili,Parfums de Marly," at the intersection of desire and delicacy, cassili is a fruity-floral beauty that reminds us that parfums de marly does feminine scents with every bit as much modern-meets-classic complexity as their much-heralded masculines. exploding with triumphant fruitiness, yet anchored by a sophisticated woodsy gourmand base, cassili is both fashion-forward and refined, with a true parfums de marly signature. from the first spray, cassili leaps off the skin with joyful abandon, featuring mouthwatering notes of plum and redcurrant set against lushly textured florals- romantic rose, fresh mimosa and peachy plumeria, a delightful bouquet with enough sweetness to swoon over, but also enough floral firepower to seduce. as the complexly gourmand drydown- a creamy blend of vanilla and sandalwood- develops, we find ourselves completely under its spell. fresh and sweet, classic and modern, fun and sexy- cassili is a scent for women who don't need to compromise."," red currant, rose, white flowers, plum, mimosa, plumeria, petalia, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
688,ganymede,Marc-Antoine Barrois," ganymede, the rocky satellite of jupiter discovered in 1610 by galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. in collaboration with quentin bisch, marc-antoine barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, b683, an instant classic. this time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. a galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. what we think a saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in b683- airy but still substantial."," mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, immortelle absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
689,no 1 tonic blanc,Thomas Kosmala," as fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot sunday morning. no. 1 tonic blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. the neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. it's a slap in the face of heat.as the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. the sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. this one's easy  a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat. fantastic on both women and men."," bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
690,no 2 seve nouvelle,Thomas Kosmala," sã¨ve nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. with its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. a playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that wella balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-granny smith apple. this peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. sã¨ve nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. while this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives sã¨ve nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once."," grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
691,no 3 crepuscule ardent,Thomas Kosmala," crã©puscule ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. echoes of a sweet tuscan leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. the intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. crã©puscule ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an arabian style amber settles in towards the base. nothing sweet or syrupy, however  here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. this is the scent that a valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light."," saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
692,no 4 apres lamour,Thomas Kosmala," aprã¨s l'amour is a 1960's serge gainsbourg song filtered through the synth pop sensibilities of the 1980's: candied lemon-rind musks and animalic notes suspended in a haze of modern woody-ambery aromachemicals. it smells like human skin after lovemaking  erotically charged, moist, musky  but thanks to a mesh of powerfully dry, smoky woods and electric ambers, broadcast at high volume to the rest of the world. it's this constant shifting of the scent from intimate to radiant and back to intimate again that makes aprã¨s l'amour work. it seems to come with its own atmosphere - a crackle of electricity in the air; the rumbling of a storm to come. utterly modern, even a bit brash, it's one of those my-skin-but-better fragrances that send out a subliminal message of attractiveness without you really knowing why or how. if you like scents such as molecule 01 and another 13, make sure you don't miss out on aprã¨s l'amour."," bitter orange, lemon zest, aromatic notes, fresh spice, dry wood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
693,no 5 frenesie,Thomas Kosmala," while most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, frã©nã©sie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. the soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. if we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. a fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. lovely, and quite innocent-smelling."," saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
694,no 6 brume radieuse,Thomas Kosmala," brume radieuse proves that thomas kosmala has a particular sleight of hand when it comes to creating oud fragrances that depart from the norm. if frã©nã©sie is a bon-bon of oud seen through a misty haze of jammy osmanthus, then brume radieuse is its equally floral, but grown-up sister, full of a simmering sensuality that makes you sit up straight in your chair. a bruise of blackcurrant juice  thick and tannic  stains the opening a deep purplish black and sets up a sexy fruity-rose beat that carries on throughout. at the heart, a nugget of salty black truffle  this would be the oud  is flanked on all sides by a chorus of juicy peach and coconut notes, the combination of which bears some resemblance to the mouthwatering aquatic-black chocolate accord that underpins tom ford's black orchid. a veritable riot of fruit, flowers, coconut, peach, and salty-earthy notes, brume radieuse shouldn't really work, and yet does. this is one sexy, feminine fruity-floral oud bomb that will not go without notice. the equivalent of that special black dress you wear like a weapon."," blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
695,no 7 le sel de la terre,Thomas Kosmala," le sel de la terre is proof that leonardo da vinci's assertion thatsimplicity is the ultimate sophistication is correct. infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. if it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. the musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. le sel de la terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in monsieur balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. a salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of calone or ambroxan. fantastic. we know what we're drenching ourselves this summer."," bergamot, italian lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
696,no 8 tonic vert,Thomas Kosmala," tonic vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. with its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. yet this is not a classic green scent like no. 19 or even green irish tweed  tonic vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. the combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
697,no 9 bukhoor elixir de,Thomas Kosmala," bukhoor, or bakhoor as it is sometimes known, is the arabic name for woodchips that have been soaked in precious essential oils, mixed with shards of frankincense and other resins, and finally pressed into soft, brownish bricks to be smoked slowly over an incense burner. all over the middle east, bukhoor is burned generously to banish domestic smells of cooking and to make the home smell warm and welcoming to visitors. bukhoor, thomas kosmala's take on the theme, honors its source material by being rich, smoky, and pugnacious, with an arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic. the animalic bite of aged hindi oud hits the nose first, its characteristic aroma of raw leather, and slightly dirty hay burning a blaze across the olfactory landscape. the scent mellows considerably in the base, where it takes a turn for dry and smoky, a smoldering woods note infusing the atmosphere with the marvelous scent of burnt paper, benzoin, and brown sugar. a bold, no-holds-barred take on an ancient material, and one that proves kosmala's skill in handling it."," woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
698,beaute du diable,Liquides Imaginaires," ""would you be willing to sell your soul to the devil to possess his perfume? this essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction."" so reads liquides imaginaires' tagline for beaute du diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep. you're nervous, but intrigued, and as soon as their scent hits your nose, you know that for tonight, at least, you're going to go wherever they want you to go. that's the seductive, mysterious power of beaute du diable."," lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
699,oud monarch,Bortnikoff," plenty of fragrances are powerful or complex, but what makes a scent truly regal? in the case of oud monarch, the answer is power and complexity in the service of pure, indulgent, delightful comfort. just as areej le dore's oud luwak gave us the why-didn't-we-think-of-that savory voluptuousness of oud and coffee, so too does oud monarch delve deep into gourmand territory, delivering a richly mouthwatering cocoa-infused oud scent as luxuriously smooth as the finest royal vestments. while the oud on display is as precious and potent as in any scent we carry (as with all bortnikoff ouds, it features frequent collaborator russian adam's treasured and rare ""feel oud""), the introduction of a rich cacao note does a miraculous thing, smoothing the animalic roar of the oud into a smooth and delicious purr that still resonates with power. it's so blissfully intense that it truly takes a moment for your nose to adjust, at which point you can appreciate the masterful attention to detail behind the potency- smooth, sweet florals, spiced tobacco and resin- all perfectly pitched to keep every sniff unique and intriguing. oud lovers, chocolate fanatics, come together: here is a fragrance fit for a monarch."," magnolia, frangipani, rose de mai, himalayan rose, cinnamon, tobacco, oud merauke, oud co chang (feel-oud), cacao, civet, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
700,amber cologne,Bortnikoff," what makes bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. take amber cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. it's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? it seems bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. it doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. and once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. perhaps the easiest-to-wear bortnikoff yet, amber cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality."," bergamot, lemon, white and pink grapefruit, sweet orange, cardamom, frangipani, jasmine sambac, virginia cedarwood, sandalwood, grey and brown ambergris, oud from sri lanka, bouya oud, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
701,musk khabib,Bortnikoff," musk khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. but we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. it's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. lovers of areej le dore's russian musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again. don't miss it."," bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, ylang-ylang, cedarwood, tolu balsam, ambergris, deer musk, oakmoss, vetiver, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
702,sensual instinct,Montale," lush, sweet, and deeply intoxicating, sensual instinct is a journey through a kaleidoscopic fantasyland where mouthwatering fruit, romantic florals, and rich gourmand notes intertwine with uncontrollable abandon. a must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey. as the ambered, lushly drawn florals of the heart notes swell, so too does a delectable tiramisu accord, all set against a rich, gently earthy patchouli. and as the gourmand base of coffee, cacao, and vanilla intensifies, so too does the seductive power of this unforgettable scent. lose yourself in the delicious haze of sensual instinct- your body knows what to do."," bergamot, mandarin, cardamom, saffron, whisky, amberwood, jasmine, rose, tiramisu, patchouli leaves, cacao, coffee, vanilla, oakmoss, cedarwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
703,vetiver patchouli,Montale," with so much attention paid to montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello red vetiver!). and so it is with great pleasure that we introduce vetiver patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. from the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. while we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, fresh montale. we've missed you."," bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
704,oud dream,Montale," when one thinks of a montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. and while those are wonderful, oud dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. the key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of roses musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of montale's other oud scents. but once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when oud dream has its chance to shine."," bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
705,holy water,La Via Del Profumo," a rose-and-sandal attar in the body of a french eau de cologne. in the middle east and india, some attars are composed specifically to protect the soul from djinns, or evil spirits. in the west, we use citrusy colognes to refresh the body in hot weather. both concepts are rooted in the belief that certain materials in perfumery possess an excoriating, cleansing power to drive out bad spirits and bad smells. abdes salaam attar's holy water (aqua santa) is a perfume  bridge between the eastern concept of purifying one's soul and the western concept of refreshing the physical. in pairing a bitter orange note with a dusty, ethereal frankincense, and placing it all in the context of a fresh eau de cologne, holy water emerges as a true hybrid between the eastern and western eaux de protection'. it's an almost medieval idea, but it works perfectly. a sweet, carefree orange blossom note gentles the piney austerity of the frankincense, softening what could have been an angular church incense into a hazy cloud of fruit, rose, and sandalwood. although more fresh than sweet, holy water has a pleasing marshmallowy softness at its core that mitigates the impact of the tougher resinous and woody notes. it smells clean, vigorous, and above all, spiritually uplifting. apply generously in times of sadness, melancholy, or simply when the greyness of the sky is wearing you down. holy water is a shot of sunshine delivered straight to your soul."," frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
706,mecca balsam,La Via Del Profumo," opening on a rich, smoky stew of incense over the crackle of dried tobacco leaf, mecca balsam sends the senses reeling, as if you'd suddenly stepped into the scent trail of a thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft as they circle the black stone in mecca. despite the tarry heft of the sticky balsams and resins, there is an airy sweetness to the underlying structure  a sort of smoked-out incense fairy dust  that elevates the scent and keeps it airborne. a common complaint leveled at incense scents is that they feel cold or severe, but there's no danger of that here. dubrana has balanced the ancient salve-like feel of the incense with a musky, saline labdanum that reads like warm skin, in one stroke banishing any thought of high church and drawing our mind instead to what he originally intended mecca balsam to reflect: the seething mass of human souls gathered around the kaaba to perform the hajj. mecca balsam is both sacred and divine, therefore, pitching the throat-catching aridity of incense against the warm, sweet embrace of flowers and amber. unusual in that it simultaneously purifies and comforts, mecca balsam feels less like perfume than it does a statement of faith."," indian tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
707,milano caffe,La Via Del Profumo," milan is a city that prides itself on the uncompromising purity of its espresso, and in milano caffã©, the roasted bitterness of the bean meets its match in a square of viciously dark chocolate. if you've ever sipped an espresso while nibbling on a bar of 80% cacao chocolate, then you'll be familiar with the dark, burnt edge that connects them on the venn diagram of taste. dubrana feeds it to us straight for a while  no sugar or milk  and it's so intense that little sips are in order. earthy and bold, the scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like the steamy vapors in a milanese coffee house. slowly, the master eases up on the intensity of the coffee-cocoa double whammy, drip-feeding a powdery iris into the mix like a tip of the milk jug. this is followed closely by the mocha almond creamer of tonka bean. now we move out of pure espresso territory and into the creamy, cocoa-sprinkled milkiness of a cappuccino. it's rich but definitely not sweet, a hint of fiery cinnamon in the opoponax lending a nubbin of spice that adds texture to the silken flow. a dash of incense additionally lends an interesting salt-n-pepper tartness that stops any gourmandise in its tracks. still incredibly indulgent, milano caffã© is the tira-mi-su (meaning pick-me-up' in italian) the adults in the room have been waiting for."," coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
708,oakmoss,La Via Del Profumo," oakmoss (quercia di muschio) is deceptively named, because, despite the clear presence of oakmoss, this scent is far more about vetiver than moss. still, the genius of the fragrance  for us  lies in the fact that dominique dubrana has obviously mined the areas of convergence between these two materials to emerge with a creature that has a foot in both worlds. thus, the marine-like inkiness of the oakmoss connects with the rooty earthiness of vetiver via the crunch of sea salt and a shadowy forest floor' gloom. in the background, a dry, minimally smoky sandalwood provides a palette against which the notes of earth, grass, root, and lichen can really pop. strangely, for a scent so heavily inspired by the elements of earth, grass, moss, and wood, oakmoss is far more elegant and pulled together' than the kind of scent you'd throw on for a hike in the woods. in fact, its crisp, tailored lines make it a perfect candidate for formal office wear. but however you choose to use it, the fact remains that oakmoss is a riveting distillation of everything rooty, wet, and green in the forest. we find it to be soul-restoring and exciting in equal measure."," vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
709,oud caravan no 1,La Via Del Profumo," abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. commissioned by an arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the gulf region, dominique dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. oud caravan no. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor  what dubrana termed the ultimate oud fragrance  but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third oud caravan. today, all three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.oud caravan no. 1 was composed to provide the oud beginner with a primer on what the material actually smells like. to this end, the perfume amalgamates several key characteristics of different oud terroirs and blends them into a seamless whole to give the wearer an idea of the real deal, without compromising on wearability. in oud caravan no. 1, the camphoraceous, minty bite of a borneo-style oud gives the opening a punchy freshness that contrasts delightfully with the animalistic warmth of the aged indian oud that lies just beneath. imagine a bengali tiger and what he smells like: you sense the clean fur of the animal himself, but also the peppery heat of his breath and the dried-straw inkiness of his dung. indian oud, especially the aged stuff, as used here, is the stuff of kings - as noble as it is ferociously animalic. spicy, masculine, and leathery are the three words we'd choose to describe this statement-making scent. wear it to mark your territory."," natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
710,oud caravan no 2,La Via Del Profumo," abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. commissioned by an arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the gulf region, dominique dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. oud caravan no. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor  what dubrana termed the ultimate oud fragrance  but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third oud caravan. today, all three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.oud caravan no. 2 was born out of the suggestions from dubrana's testing group that no. 1 was simply too leathery, dry, and masculine to win over women. dubrana listened carefully. after all, his avowed mission with oud caravan no. 1 had been to make the ultimate oud fragrance that would sweep newcomers to oud oil, including women, off their feet and expose them to the glory of natural oud. oud caravan no. 2 handles the animalistic, barnyardy qualities of oud oil in a much lighter fashion, softening its leathery rudeness with an earthy vanilla and a subdued floral note, something creamy and pale like freshly-opened tuberose buds. the topnotes, similar to no. 1, open with a medicinal, stemmy freshness, which this time seems to come from tuberose rather than from borneo oud. although still unmistakably oudy, oud caravan no. 2 is an ethereal, dewy take on a famously gruff material  something that arwen from lord of the rings might wear."," natural aged, wild bengali oud oil, white flowers, laotian oud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
711,oud caravan no 3,La Via Del Profumo," abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. commissioned by an arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the gulf region, dominique dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. oud caravan no. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor  what dubrana termed the ultimate oud fragrance  but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third oud caravan. today, all three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.oud caravan no. 3 is the culmination of dubrana's work on the caravan series, and the version he feels best encapsulates his vision of a universally-pleasing oud scent. removing the sharp camphoraceous topnotes that presaged both caravan no. 1 and no. 2, dubrana envelops the wild agarwood oil in a warm, fudgy date-like sweetness, using dried fruit and amber notes to subtly nudge the texture dial from leather to velvet. rich and mellow, oud caravan no. 3 goes down smoothly, like a 50-year-old scotch. remarkably, dubrana has steered the oudiness of this scent away from the jungly wetness of the first two scents and towards an airiness that feels like the windows being thrown open onto a closed-up room. as smoky as it is rich, oud caravan no. 3 is just animalic enough to remind you that you're wearing real oud, but smooth enough for you to enjoy it without the steep learning curve. as great for women as it is for men."," natural aged wild bengali oud oil, dates, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
712,amber chocolate,La Via Del Profumo," amber chocolate is a lush gourmand amber that should come with a sticker that readsfor grown-ups only. put aside any thoughts you might have of the kind of yummy vanilla-and-berries smell surrounding young girls like a nuclear cloud  this is seriously dark and sexy stuff. a molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. the fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it's a guilt-free indulgence. despite the almost comically simple name, amber chocolate is not a simple affair. there's a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny cuban tobacco leaf. we think it's the real vanilla absolute that's been used in amber chocolate. woody and resolutely non-sweet, it lends a boozy depth that reads in some lights as brandy or amaretto. amber chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes the golden sweetness of amber so effectively that even the amber-averse might be tempted. but honestly, if you ever loved or bought a bottle of bruno fazzolari's ummagumma, slumberhouse ore, or guerlain's gourmand coquin, then this boozy chocolate amber is 100% for you."," chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
713,hindu kush,La Via Del Profumo," hindu kush takes its name and inspiration from the 500-mile mountain range running along the hinterlands of afghanistan, kashmir, and pakistan, characterized by wild pine forests that give way to jagged mountain peaks. the scent mirrors the sensory contrast between forest and stone to perfection, capturing in particular the chilly isolation of rugged places unreachable to most humans. it is a meditative scent that taps into our need for silence and contemplation.  the contrasts in hindu kush are what drive the scent. in pairing the cool lemon-and-pine notes of pure frankincense with the fiery heat of ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, hindu kush achieves an incredible fire-and-ice character that captures our interest throughout. resinous, mossy woods create the impression of oiled floorboards, a smell that is both comforting and nostalgic. the incense notes are smoky and balsamic, but the freshness of pine leaves drags the priest's censer out of the chapel and into the forest clearing. it's a scent of worship, yes, but here we're worshipping at the altar of nature herself. picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat over fires, surrounded by the howling ice winds of the hindu kush, and you get an idea of the mysterious alchemy between the culinary and the spiritual at play here. we can think of nothing quite like it."," spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
714,aenotus,Puredistance," on a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of aeolia, a mythic god tends to the divine winds. at a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction. this is the power of aenotus, itself a fragrance of contrast: freshness and warmth, comfort and primal power. while puredistance founder jan ewoud vos has a personal connection to every scent, aenotus was conceived to be his signature- a scent that had to be instantly refreshing, while also presenting a rich, long-lasting second phase more sophisticated than your average ""fresh"" scent. and with the help of master perfumer antoine lie, aenotus delivers, wowing us with an eye-popping, euphoric burst of complex citrus and mint notes that smoothly flows into a warm, deeply sensual base of mossy skin musk that lingers on skin for hours and clothes for days. this rare achievement is possible via puredistance's no-matter-the-cost philosophy, as aenotus boasts an astounding, unprecedented 48% perfume oil concentration developed over three painstaking years. was it worth it? close your eyes, spray it on, and when your feet finally touch the ground again, decide for yourself."," orange, mandarin, lemon, yuzu, mint, blackcurrant bud, petitgrain, oakmoss, patchouli, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
715,tabac,La Via Del Profumo," tobacco fragrances often get the weight' thing wrong. too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. tabac by abdes salaam attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. the tobacco leaf in tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. as you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. but fear not! the resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. it's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. in a word  suave."," tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
716,isle of man,Frapin," you are invited to experience the exhilaration of life lived at 100mph, whipping down the wind-swept coastlines and tight mountain curves of the isle of man in all its famed race-week splendor. born of a collaboration between frapin founder (and motorsports enthusiast) david frossard and perfumer alienor massenet, isle of man is a testament to adventure, a crisp, fierce adrenaline rush of citrus, florals and oceanic zest that stirs the soul. in each breath, we feel the sparkle of sunlight in notes of grapefruit and bitter orange, while herbaceous, floral and salt notes brings the uniquely british beauty of the island into vivid contrast- fresh, wild basil, fields of wildflowers, and the bracing freshness of ocean air. it's the kind of wonderful, fully realized men's scent that's every bit as sexy on her- the only prerequisite is an untamed soul."," grapefruit, bitter orange, basil, salt accord, freesia, violet, ironwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22619.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

754,cuir cavalier,Parfums MDCI," gericault's charging chasseur, his first exhibited work, already demonstrated the artist's impressive talent for subverting the tropes of convention (in this case the heroic portrait of a napoleonic cavalryman) in the service of creating a more complex, challenging narrative. it's the perfect inspiration for cuir cavalier, a richly spiced oud and leather scent that nods to the heavyweights of the smoky leather category while carving out a smooth, sophisticated niche all its own. cuir cavalier opens bright and fiery, with a crisp italian red tangerine paired with a luscious saffron, leading into a rich floral leather heart. a warm, powerful base of oud and vanilla hums beautifully, a perfect chord with the still potent thread of saffron that continues to elevate the entire composition with a poised masculine gracefulness. like a masterpiece that presents an iconic image in a way you've never before seen, cuir cavalier is a bold new portrait of a classic concept."," italian red tangerine, saffron, rose, iris, cypriol, white honey, oud, soft leather, cedar, tonka bean, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36524.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
755,chameleon,Zoologist," like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the indian ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. the sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. the salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. something stirs  an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? no one knows. the secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep madagascar guessing. what we do know, however, is that zoologist chameleon is a deliciously elusive blend of bright florals, hypnotic musks, and exotic fruit that can turn the wearer into anything they want to be. madagascar, home to half of the world's species of chameleons, holds the key to zoologist chameleon. like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island. whether you desire to shroud yourself in an air of mystery, or blatantly flaunt your true colours, chameleon becomes you."," bergamot, lemon, madagascar ylang ylang, mango, pink pepper, star fruit, violet leaves, cashmeran, clove, coconut, frangipani, jasmine, saffron, salty skin accord, sea breeze, amber, woods, musks, opoponax, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
756,dodo,Zoologist," the sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the indian ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. stumbling drunkenly from their nests, the birds waddled through the sea of luscious ferns that carpeted the forest floor, to feast on fat, ripe berries. for generations, the island paradise of mauritius nurtured the dodos, its predator-free and bountiful shores lulling them into a state of such complacency that even their wings grew idle, and flight was lost  even to memory. ultimately their evolution would betray them cruelly, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort. it's only appropriate, therefore, that zoologist dodo is as laid-back a fougere as you'll ever encounter- an ultra-fresh, green, delightfully whimsical blend of fruit, flower and moss that may just lull you into a sublime state of relaxation. dodo opens with an invigorating burst of tart lime and juicy berries, inviting you to venture deep into a forest dense with vibrant ferns. delicate fiddleheads unfurl to reveal tendrils of feathery musk, as rosy florals float up to embrace them. dodo is a paradox. like those extinct inhabitants of mauritius, the scent is at once classic and iconic, yet eerily unknowable and endlessly fascinating. the ideal fougere for those with an eclectic sensibility, who crave a life of leisure and contentment."," fern, lime, lychee, raspberry, ambergris, fir balsam, geranium, rose, amber, feathery musk, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
757,santal blanc,Serge Lutens," as with most perfumes in the serge lutens line, the name of the fragrance never gives you the full story. santal blanc means white sandalwood, but this is not light, airy sandalwood and its personality is far deeper than you might expect.  built on a beautiful contrast of softness and piquancy, the fragrance opens with bursts of tangy pink pepper and fresh cedar notes, while its evolution brings out a creamy white sandalwood and beautifully unexpected twists of bitter cinnamon and fenugreek. orris root (you'll recognize it as the scent of violets) rose and jasmine are background players, happy to let the woods, spices and musk mingle. perfectly at ease on a man or woman, santal blanc is enigmatic and memorable, possessing enough mystery to keep you on your toes and wondering where its next evolution will take you-- forever changing, forever mysterious, forever enchanting."," white sandalwood, fenugreek, pink pepper, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, orris root, musk, benzoin, copaiba balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

760,from the heart,Alghabra Parfums," inspired by the lush beauty of the traditional arab-islamic courtyard house and the many fruits and flowers that flourished there in the days of old damascus, from the heart is a thoroughly lovely and joyful scent. like the traditional bitter orange trees that spread their distinctively fresh aroma through the courtyard, from the heart opens bright and citrussy, with a lusciously sweet fruitiness from peach and ylang. at the core of the scent, a fully blooming flower garden exudes lush romanticism from the exquisite damask rose, as well as the full-bodied, sensual freshness of lily, all warmed by a subtle ambered base. like the warm summer air wafting through the stately courtyard, from the heart is an exuberant expression of freshness that lingers in the memory."," bergamot, bitter orange, damask rose, lily, peach, ylang ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

764,patiala,Thameen," created by cartier in 1928 for an indian maharaja, the patiala necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery.  containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. to this day, the disappearance has never been explained. in this spirit of opulence and mystery, thameen presents patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond. yet it wears as comfortably as the necklace might around one who could afford it, with a rich, lush heart of orange flower and rose that anoints the bearer as royalty. a sweet, musky amber glows for countless hours, bathing us in serene reflected light. the original patiala necklace has sadly been lost to mystery, never to be experienced in its original glory again. but with this patiala, we have a pretty good sense of just how it must have felt to experience such luxurious beauty."," citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

766,molecule 04  travel spray,Escentric Molecules," following on in the escentric molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for themeat of a fragrance,  molecule 04 focuses entirely on javanol,  a powerful givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. in the hands of anyone else other than geza schoen,  this could have been a disaster  javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is,  well,  too much. but this is a triumph. schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy,  creamy,  and steamy,  tropical facets of javanol are brought forward,  and all its heaviness is left behind. it feels light,  almost fresh,  with a greenstripped bark note that brings in an element of the great outdoors.

""it smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" we agree,  adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin,  giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.please note: both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. the 'alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case,  the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box.", javanol,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

782,amber teutonic,D.S. and Durga," as the companion scent to the japanese-inspired amber kisu, you'd be forgiven for thinking the oh-so-european-named amber teutonic would be constructed in the more traditional labdanum-and-vanilla style amber form. however, we're delighted to report that teutonic, inspired by the breathtaking old-growth forests of austria and germany, turns out to be every bit as creative as its counterpart, envisioning an amber alive with aromatic freshness, bursting with notes of pine, templin (fir) cone, and bright, stout cedarwood. a distinctively bright accord of cardamom and green mandarin adds to the luminous glow, while a rich base of smooth musk and sweet, balsamic opoponax provide a soothingly familiar amber warmth. escape to a still mythic world of towering ancient trees and magical creatures- amber teutonic is an adventure in a bottle."," alpine cedar, cardamom, green mandarin, geranium, european larch, templin cone, pine, opoponax, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68682.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
783,each other,The House Of Oud," inspired by the wild and wonderful street art of thoo founder andrea casotti's native milan, each other is a collaboration with famed milanese graffiti writer kayone that uses an electrifying contrast of bright and dark notes to represent the urban vitality of their shared hometown. the fragrance opens high in the clouds, with a blinding burst of citrus shining like a ray of light on the iconic outline of the duomo di milano. but there's much more to this vibrant, bustling metropolis than tourist attractions, and each other quickly takes to the living, breathing streets, the colorful graffiti represented in fiery spice and rich aromatics. as the sun sets and the stylish young milanese come out to play, nightfall takes the intriguingly bitter contrast of calamus and wormwood, like a strong cocktail to start the evening. finally, warm labdanum and luminous vetiver represent the city lit up, inviting and intimidating, alive in its contradictions. discover the true complexity of milan with each other- a dynamic fragrance for a city that deserves nothing less."," citrus blend, grapefruit, pink pepper, coriander, calamus, wormwood, labdanum, ambergris, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76424.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
784,1900 lheure de proust,Les Bains Guerbois," 1900, the height of la belle epoque. legendary author marcel proust and a cherished confidante retire to the bains sulfureux for a day of elaborate pampering- steam, massage, and a grand tea service to while away the private hours. the delicacies enjoyed in these intimate moments make up the magical scent of 1900 l'heure de proust. our service begins with the exquisite fruits used to flavour the tea, tart, bright grapefruit and lusciously juicy blueberry, set against the smoky richness of pure black tea and the refined leather upholstering the private couch to where our subjects have retired. the unisex freshness of violet perfumes the wood-panelled room, while a tray of mouthwatering desserts- sweet pralines and creamy vanilla cake- beckon our indulgence. the scent is gorgeous, delightful, masculine and feminine intertwined- far from scandalous, but equally far from innocent. indeed, when naming a scent for proust, the bar is raised- and we're delighted to say that 1900 l'heure de proust is evocative enough to inspire a masterpiece of your own."," bergamot, blueberry, grapefruit, violet, black tea, tuscan leather, mate, gaiac, praline, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

786,sweet flowers,Montale," sweet and fresh, fresh and sweet... so often in perfume, we find one at the expense of the other, resigned to the idea that what makes our mouths water and what makes our hearts flutter are mutually exclusive. and then a wonderfully romantic confection like sweet flowers crosses our nose, and we fall in love all over again. vibrant and nimble with tingling spice and airy florals and, yet lusciously laced with sugared fruits and creamy vanilla, sweet flowers is the best of both worlds, a rare low-calorie dessert that actually delivers on its promise. youthful yet sexy, gourmand yet guilt-free, sweet flowers is a pop of pure joy you'll need to smell for yourself."," bergamot, white peach, ginger, spicy pepper, cotton candy, patchouli, jasmine, tuberose, violet, vanilla, oakmoss, grey amber, white musk, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
787,bakhoor,Montale," born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the middle east, a bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a mabkhara. the resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. as a perfume, bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. for those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss bakhoor."," oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
788,leather patchouli,Montale," let's get one thing clear- leather patchouli is not a gourmand scent. after all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. you'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as leather patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. the result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear."," leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
789,amber musk,Montale," montale, admittedly, is not known for subtlety- their bold perfumes wear their powerful middle eastern influences proudly, and as a result have become beloved of those craving fragrances of beastly projection and sillage. but that doesn't mean the venerable parisian house doesn't do subtle from time to time, and the latest example- the warm, mysterious,  amber musk- may be their best skin scent yet. like a gentle caress, sweet, warm notes of amber glide tenderly above the skin, contrasting notes of clean powder against a soft, seductively musky current of animalic sensuality. it lingers on the skin for hours, leaving a trail of warm carnality in its wake, drawing those around you in ever closer. a true secret weapon if ever there was one, amber musk isn't like your typically beastly montale scent- and it's all the sexier for it."," sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
790,mefisto gentiluomo,Xerjoff - Casamorati," mefisto gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in italy circa 1888. like its progenitor, mefisto, gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery  clean  and makes it sexy again. think the steamy aromas in a traditional italian barbershop after a shave  triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. yes, gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.right off the bat, mefisto gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. it wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel  not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. we're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. but if mefisto gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. the flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. handsome, refined, and full of italian braggadocio, mefisto gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018."," bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
791,uden overdose,Xerjoff," who says perfection can't be improved upon? though the name uden overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. how does it differ, you ask? well, while uden overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original  the essence of its fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. both are utterly charming in their different ways. but if original uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, uden overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay.  uden overdose opens similarly to uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. but while original uden turns creamy with vanilla, uden overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. think a tannic earl grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. it smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. tobacco blossom plays a central role in uden overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. this one's such a pleasure to wear. if you love fougeres (and the original uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then uden overdose is your man."," bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
792,colognise  de cologne,Nishane," in turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent. with colognise, nishane, a house well-known for rich, long-lasting extraits, takes this beloved custom and modernizes it into a dynamic, sexy, wonderfully easy-to-wear ""extrait de cologne""- a concentration that captures all of the vibrance and exuberance of a traditional citrus cologne, in a much longer-lasting 18% concentration. on first spray, colognise positively explodes with bright, fresh lemon and bergamot, a fitting tribute to the simple, beautiful lemon colognes of its inspiration- but even in the opening, a smooth, beautiful green tea note hints at the greater complexity that lies ahead. soon, an rich, emerging floral heart of lily and jasmine adds dimensionality and lush, unisex character, even as the citrus continues to sparkle. a sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once. created in the spirit of hospitality, colognise is so very effortless to wear that you'll have to decide whether to share it with everyone- or keep it all for yourself."," bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77451.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

807,red square,Mad et Len," red is the color of passion, of warning, of danger. and what can we say? we hate to be all matchy-matchy', but red square sure lives up to its name! it scoops up some of the fieriest red' notes in perfumery, like red pepper, red musk, clove or cinnamon, and padauk wood, an african rosewood, and whips them up into a hot blaze, cooling them down again with ash and aromatics for a never-ending dance of hot and cold that holds the wearer's attention throughout. key to red square's exciting aroma is nar (meaning fire' in arabic), a rare red boswellia sacra frankincense from oman that has a fresh, spicy pine-like aroma pitched halfway between elemi and cinnamon bark. the opening is a column of white smoke billowing from a censer where elemi resin burns over eucalyptus branches, liquid tar, and cloves, its trail purified by an antiseptic ginger note. we love the minty, camphoraceous aspect of the incense, because it injects a leafy bitterness. before we get too comfortable, however, red square plunges everything into a bath of hot pitch, like eau lente poured into the la brea tar pits. this gutsy move is what transforms what could have been just a nice incense scent into something mesmerizingly different. the scent continues on in this spiced, musky tar-like track for a while before smoothing out into a peppery incense accord that reminds us of the aldehydic coldness of avignon (comme des garcons) or lavs (unum). we recommend red square to anyone who thinks that incense no longer holds any surprises. although it riffs off the bone structure of some of the greats, red square takes us in some new and surprising directions."," padauk wood, red frankincense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
808,noir encens,Mad et Len," noir encens is based on the scent of mad et len's beautiful noir encens potpourri  little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils  as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 no. xliii encens. the 2018 noir encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing high mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. the almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. one thing is for sure, though: noir encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. if you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as fã¨ve dã©licieuse by dior privã©e, hypnotic poison by dior, or le baiser du dragon by cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on mad et len's 2018 noir encens."," amber, frankincense, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

822,princesses de malabar,Lubin," legends tell of the mythical princesses of the malabar coast of western india, wise women who ruled their kingdom with wisdom and equanimity; in the 18th century, their tale became a shorthand for gracious, fair, female leadership. now, in a time where that quality is disappointingly ephemeral, lubin delivers a fragrance meant to inspire and enchant a new generation of empowered women. bursting with fruity-floral energy that floats into a gorgeously weightless cloud of powdery musk, princesses of malabar is a bridge between past and present, a thoroughly modern and delightful feminine scent with an undeniable link to the glamorous perfumes of centuries past. princesses of malabar opens with the dynamic sparkle of aldehydes and citrus, a bathing light that cleanses palette and soul to make way for the rich but never-heavy fruity floral base- a juicy spritz of peach, the sumptuous lushness of magnolia, the sexy-sweet combination of jasmine and ylang. it's every bit as fun and youthful as the latest mass market blockbuster, only a thousand times more sophisticated. the contrast is only heightened in the vintage-inspired base, which deploys the powdery strength of iris atop a pillow-soft confection of amber, musk, and tonka, flirting with the mouthwatering appeal of a gourmand while never tipping into over-sugared dessert territory. it's a sublime formula, as fun as it is formal, as sweet as it is smooth, as fresh as it is fancy- a 21st century feminine scent for the young at heart and old souls alike. we could all use a bit of royal inspiration in these trying times, and princesses de malabar seems destined to become a new classic."," cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, arabian jasmine, nosy be ylang ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/312028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
823,liquid illusion,Juliette Has a Gun," liquid illusion opens with such a lush, fruity almond note that we instantly picture marie antoinette wearing it, giggling with girlfriends as she nibbles on pastel-colored petit fours.  it's over-the-top delicious. heliotrope, the tiny purple flower that smells like cherries and marzipan, ramps up the nutty gourmandise of this opening, but also ushers in a tart floral freshness that breathes air into the rafters. but liquid illusion is not just a fluffy gourmand delight (although it's certainly that, too). after a while, you become aware of the scaffolding beneath, with its complex system of cantilevers designed to keep those almond topnotes aloft. in particular, iris absolute, its shy aroma strengthened and made incredibly diffusive by irone and iracine (iris root oil compounds), casts a berried, violety forcefield around the scent. tuberose absolute shows up, but comes armed with a girlish bubblegum nuance rather than its usual full desk of indole and rubber. the mix of all these floral and fruit elements is irresistible because it teeters on the line between innocent and seductive, girlish and come-hither. benzoin imparts a gritty, brown sugar texture to the base that will make you want to bite your arm, but the real stars are the creamy tonka bean and musks, back-up generators of real balsamic warmth. liquid illusion is just the thing for when things just feel really bleak; a floral that skips the usual arm's-length froideur of flowers and offers you delicious, seductive warmth instead."," heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
824,love tuberose,Amouage," are you on a diet? well, sorry, because love tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. amouage's second installment in its secret garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, love tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more trã¨s leches cake. picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. the chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. love tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. an unabashedly feminine scent, love tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. but would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? no - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone."," tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41894.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

833,flash back in new york,Olfactive Studio," what an interesting and original flanker! like the fuzzy picture of a snowy new york avenue taken as its starting point, flash back in new york weaves rhubarb, apple, leather, and wood together so seamlessly that it's difficult to pick out the individual lines at first. but slowly, like the shape of a building or a person emerging from a blur of snowflakes, we are able to make out the earthiness of vetiver, its grey-brown smokiness illuminated in spots by the brightness of unripe fruit. if the scent begins in earth and fruit, it soon develops in a series of surprising directions that keep our interest engaged. one strand leads us off into a gently spicy tonka bean diversion, another into a smoky violet-and-saffron leather, and yet another into an aromatic woody finish. we especially love the contrast between the soft warmth of the cumin and tonka pushing against the milky coolness of the leather and papyrus. just as in the original photo by vivienne gucwa, flash back in new york is all about the hard angles of light slicing through a fuzzy darkness. if you love either santal 33 by le labo or terre d'hermes by hermes but wish for a gentler, more diffuse take that's stunning on either a man or a woman, then try flash back in new york. its woodsy, androgynous sexiness will appeal even to those who don't normally wear fragrance."," cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, tuscan leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
834,woody mood,Olfactive Studio," with woody mood, perfumer betrand duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall  crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire  compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. the inspiration for woody mood is roger steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a california redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. since duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (timbuktu, avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. woody mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. from the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. the contrast in woody mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. like au coeur du desert, woody mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. if you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by olfactive studio is a no-brainer."," bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
835,kings wood fragrance concentree,Shay & Blue," not in the least bit like aventus! just putting that out there (we're aware that pineapple is a trigger word for some). no, kings wood takes the oft-abused pineapple and sets it among aromatic herbs and greenery for a gentlemanly english garden fougã¨re that's mercifully low on sugar. it's clean, aromatic, and above all, unpretentious. we love it. although the topnote is clearly pineapple, it has a thrilling tartness that leans more on grapefruit and tart greenery than tropical cocktail. its fougã¨re bone structure really comes into focus once that big, handsome oak note settles in, shoring up all the peppery herbs and fruit with its broad shoulders. tilted towards the masculine side of the scale, kings wood belongs on the confident titan of industry who secretly dreams of being back in his garden, potting plants and hacking back overgrown brambles. the leather accord in the far drydown is a delightful late addition, ruffling the elegant surface of this gentlemanly fougã¨re with a surprisingly skanky note redolent of animal hide and undergrowth. we see kings wood working fantastically on a man (or woman) who loves the rustic vigor of herbs, fruit, oak, and good clean dirt but needs it packaged up into an elegant structure for a conservative setting."," pineapple, fern, sichuan pepper, oak, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
836,cuir celeste,Ex Nihilo," does artistic talent transcend its medium? that's the question posed by ex nihilo's bold new visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with ex nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. for the premiere of the series, they've teamed ex nihilo house perfumer quentin bisch with acclaimed photographer mathieu cesar, and the result is cuir celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality b&w print. cuir celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. the leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. the effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. if you love modern floral leather, don't miss cuir celeste- it's a work of art."," black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
837,eo no 1 edp,Ensar Oud," when ensar released sultan leather attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. but to make an eau de parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. still, the people were calling out for an edp. and now, here we are. and what does an all-natural ensar oud edp smell like? we're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr kyaratul mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from sultan qaboos's private collection. the results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding  romantic depth. there's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. a luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain italian leather completes the vision. edps like this don't come around anymore- don't miss your chance to experience one."," rose, oud, leather, tobacco, tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
838,tyrannosaurus rex,Zoologist," a sultry heat wafts across the land, lapped up greedily by the abundant flora that thrives in its midst. trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. the cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.zoologist tyrannosaurus rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust. the mighty tyrannosaurus rex is sometimes menacing, sometimes fascinating, but never, ever ordinary."," bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
839,remember me,Jovoy Paris," remember me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to qatar that perfumer cecile zarokian took with jovoy founder, francois henin. while in doha, cecile fell in love with the scent of karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of doha, remember me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents.  combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, remember me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. everything here is remarkably well balanced. the chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. in turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. you'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this  vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on  and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. but no, it's 100% unisex! unusually, what pulls remember me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. remember me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. if you love unusual, complex sweet' fragrances such as el born by carner barcelona and leder 6 by j.f. schwarzlose, then remember me might be your new obsession."," bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
840,le participe passe,Serge Lutens," do you love balsamic, resinous fragrances? are you addicted to the radiant warmth, the languorous sweetness, the oriental spice? serge lutens certainly does, with deep, stylish accords of resin and balsam present in the background of many of his most classic scents. with le participe passe, the always literate lutens looks back on the oriental scents of his past, delivering a tribute to these cornerstones of perfumery written in indulgently pure richness. featuring a spectacular overdose of smoothly powerful egyptian balsam, participe passe deploys a full complement of resins, dried fruit, leather and caramel to further soften every sharp edge, leaving you in a dreamlike state of balsamic bliss. a delicate sprinkle of spice provides subtle sophistication, but this is a balsamic scent through and through, meant for those who simply can't get enough. if that's you, we'd advise you not to hesitate- le participe passe is exactly what you're searching for."," egyptian balsam, resins, caramel, cumin, leather, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
841,santal nabataea,Mona di Orio," inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at petra, jordan, fredrik dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century bc nabataean kingdom, for whom petra was the capital city, back to life. a nomadic tribe by nature, petra was a touchstone for the nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. santal nabataea honors the inspiration of petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. and wow, does it succeed. in exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, santal nabataea is that rare thing  a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. a pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. all the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal  the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. if it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling santal nabataea a priority. featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from australia as well as indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal."," black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, australian santalum album sandalwood, indian sandalwood, coffee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51730.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
842,tokyo,Gallivant," it's 6 am in tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. as the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. gallivant's tokyo captures the moment when old tokyo meets new, the sweet smokiness of japanese incense of kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. there's a lot going on in tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in tokyo, the scent. but despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern japanese urban culture. the exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. this might seem more arabian-inspired than japanese at first until you notice that the gentler japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. big city neon energy meets old world tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect."," yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/766007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
843,34 boulevard saint germain edp,Diptyque," 34 boulevard saint germain, the home of the original diptyque boutique, is as close to a royal address as it gets in niche fragrance. still alive almost 60 years after first opening its doors, ""the maison"" is both an ever-evolving palace of luxury, and also a timeless shrine to its own origins, a magical space lined in rich waxed blond wood, vintage cabinets stuffed with fragrant curios, and the soft, warm comfort of sunlight streaming through the large, welcoming windows. the scent inside is an unknowable mix of every perfume sprayed, every candle displayed, and every raw material played with- a wholly unique form of olfactive serendipity. it's this complete aura, both the body and soul of the boutique, captured in 34 saint germain boulevard eau de parfum. perfectly balancing the warm, nostalgic tones of vanilla, sandalwood and tonka against a robust, multifaceted pink pepper, this edp feels both modern and timeless, comforting and sensual, fresh and warm. like the wondrous shop to which it owes its name, 34 saint germain boulevard edp is sure to cast a spell on all who discover it."," pink pepper, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483250.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
844,hemingway,Masque Milano," masque milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. so when they met iff trainee fanny bal, apprenticing under the legendary dominique ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. and who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than ernest hemingway? with access to the full resources of the laboratoire monique remy, bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. and proprietary vetiver heart lmr, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance."," ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart lmr, haitian vetiver, java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

847,mizu,Di Ser," mizu, meaning water in japanese, combines zesty yuzu with spearmint for an aqua seltzer opening that feels like ice water running down your spine. it's the perfect palate cleanser, especially on stupid hot days when your brain seems to stop working. although mizu is technically a woody-aromatic citrus, you wouldn't mistake mizu for a french or american eau de cologne. there's something intrinsically japanese in its transparency, delicate sourness, and complex use of herbs. mizu smells exotic, but subtly so. moving effortlessly from its sparkling spearmint-and-yuzu topnotes to an earthy rosewood and vetiver base, its transitions are as smooth as flowing water. in the heart, it picks up a slight spiciness from the smattering of clovey pinks (carnations) and green cardamom, but it's a subtle accent rather than a plot point. throughout, the tone is cool and astringent, the unami-rich rosewood and aromatics devoid of anything sweet or thickening. mizu smells all-natural, because it is all-natural, but a japanese lightness of touch keeps it from feeling muddy. instead, mizu wears like moonlight - peppery, silvery, and buoyant. we're kind of obsessed with this scent here at luckyscent, because not only does it keep us feeling refreshed on turgid afternoons, but its balance of zesty brightness and earthy sourness keeps us engaged. it's that rare thing  an easy wear that's also whip smart."," japanese yuzu (citrus junos), spearmint, paper pink, cardamom, rosewood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

850,tobacco oud intense,TOM FORD Private Blend," wonderfully soft, intriguingly smooth, the original tobacco oud was a soothing, yet thoroughly masculine scent that flirted with darkness, but never truly approached the edge. but sometimes, you don't want to play it safe, and tobacco oud intense is more than happy to oblige, removing the training wheels from the original and amping up the spices, resins, and animalics to deliver a bolder, more daring tobacco oud guaranteed to turn heads and raise pulses. a sweeter, spicier vein of coriander pairs with a doubled-dose of castoreum, infusing every moment with raw, animalic magnetism that commands attention without ever turning sour, and the signature tobacco and oud combination is robustly masculine, smokier and unapologetically fiercer, while still displaying a sophisticated woodsiness. rich and powerful, yet still tuxedo-appropriate, it's another knockout tobacco offering from tom ford you won't want to miss."," coriander, tobacco, oud, labdanum, amber, sandalwood, cedar, tonka, castoreum, patchouli click here for ingredients ãclose tobacco oud intense by tom ford private blend ingredients please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.  please refer to the ingredient list on the product package you receive for the most up to date list of ingredients.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63567.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

852,ruh,Pekji," ruh, meaning spirit in sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. and that's a rare feat. ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. a blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. but the saffron is the real chameleon of ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. breathe in ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. yep, ruh has soul. luca turin thought so too, awarding ruh a 4 star rating in the perfume guide (2018)."," rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
853,zeybek,Pekji," zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. the way zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. for us, zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3d picture of a horse stall. the central flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. this thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. the only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention."," bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
854,odoon,Pekji," a masterful treatise on a single material, odoon takes us on a journey through the stored memory cells of a piece of wood, from the depths of the forest to the workshops, from sap to the burnt ashes in the grate of a fire. odoon is wonderfully rich, balsamic, and warm  full of character and complexity despite its obsessive, almost singular focus.  the structure is remarkably uncluttered, focusing on exposing each facet of wood and turning it over for our attention. first, we smell the minty camphor of a freshly bladed log of wood, sap springing up as if startled by its sudden release. then the roast coffee warmth of cedar, its peppery mealiness exposed to the air for the first time. slowly, the wood dries out to the caramelic dryness of sandalwood awaiting the carver's tool, where it is polished to a high shine. it all comes together in a wisp of smoke and ash, nuggets of resin in the fine grain catching on fire here and there at the edges. odoon is warm, deep symphony of wood notes that somehow transcends the simplicity of structure to take on a soul. if you love any of the comme des garcons woods-themed fragrances (wonderwood, sequoia, hinoki, and so on), and want to see what a more natural, artisanal take smells like, then get yourself some odoon."," ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
855,battaniye,Pekji," battaniye, meaning blanket in turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. but to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. because, although undeniably rich and comforting, battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles  wool, leather, silk  than it does dessert.   the perfumer intended for battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in trabzon, a mountainous town on the black sea, and once an important gateway to persia on the spice route. and it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario  the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. but for us, battaniye is all about leather. a spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. it morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, battaniye comes off as distinctly western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding."," amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
856,eaumer,Pekji," eaumer, a play on the perfumer's name (o-mer), is the tonic we'd prescribe to anyone who's ever had a bad experience with an aquatic. forget what you know about this genre, with its overdose of calone and potent aromachemicals  eaumer is here to turn the concept of aquatic on its head and reconfigure all your expectations. when you wear eaumer, the most pleasant surprise is that a scent can be naturally rather than chemically marine-fresh. salty anise, lime, and vetiver combine to evoke the brackish freshness of a sea breeze, mercifully free of the melony sweetness common to most aquatics. the lime note sluices everything with an antiseptic brightness that will jolt you awake. the natural gasoline and rubber facets of jasmine are brought forward and accentuated, cleverly creating a petrol-on-sea-water effect that feels novel but also refreshing. when all is said and done, though, ambergris is the rock on which eaumer is built. redolent of minty tobacco, minerals, and sea salt, the ambergris fills the scent with a radiant freshness, but also a lingering mammalian funk. and it's this contrast between bright and murky that makes eaumer such a pleasure to wear on a hot day."," ambergris, anise, bergamot, haitian vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
857,b612,Nishane," in antoine de saint-exupery's beloved children's book le petit prince, the titular prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as b-612. traveling the universe, the prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on b-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" so it should come as no surprise that b-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. while the result feels sophisticated and masculine, b-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. the little prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- b-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go."," lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
858,vain & naive,Nishane," ""it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""the character of the rose in le petit prince is an extremely important one- she is the prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. with vain & naive, nishane honors the rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. vain & naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. the little prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. one sniff of vain & naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place."," bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
859,hyouge,Parfum Satori," 6th century tea master oribe furuta fiercely adhered to the teaching of sen rikyu toalways be different from others and injected a fearless and liberated sense of beauty into the world of the tea ceremony.  his hyouge (humor) pottery, called oribe-yaki, with its characteristic dark green and black designs, appears modern, even by today's standards.as a fragrance designed to honor both the man himself and the exquisite art to which he dedicated his life, hyouge is a fresh, floral green tea scent with uniquely japanese nuance.from the gently powdered green freshness of the very first moments, it's clear that hyouge is not just a tea scent, nor even just a green tea scent- it's a matcha scent, rich yet subtle, powdery yet bright, with an evocatively complex interplay of softly bitter and sweet notes. iris and violet further the nuance, eschewing typical floral lushness for a smooth, powdered, gently woodsy base. as you might expect, hyouge is a quiet scent, but like a true sado ceremony, there's not a wasted movement- each detail is a touch of perfect, deliberate beauty. matcha lovers- your new obsession has arrived.(note: trademark/name oforibe has changed tohyouge)"," green tea, sage, jasmine, violet, patchouli, woods, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
860,komorebi,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," komorebi: a japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. it represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. in the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. there are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, komorebi stands alone."," mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
861,orange x santal,Essential Parfums," orange x santal, literally orange crossed with sandalwood  simple, handsome, and to the point. a radiant composition, the scent focuses on the meeting of a remarkable bitter orange note with the authentic creaminess of santalum album grown sustainably on australian plantations, the same species of wood that gave us the original mysore sandalwood. orange x santal keeps the structure uncluttered, allowing the raw materials to speak for themselves. the orange turns from juicy pulp to aromatic rind, before settling in a salty, metallic register that feels wonderfully bracing. the aromatic bitterness of the citrus is further underlined by a chorus of dark green notes, chief among them real oakmoss, a rugged cypress, and minty basil, all of which work to lend the scent a chypric tone. the creaminess of the sandalwood in the base is exquisite, but the scent holds fast to its basic character of salty woods, moss, and orange to the end, never ceding to sweetness. leaning masculine? yes, we think so. there is something about its brisk, mossy bitterness of orange x santal that suits a man, especially if he's wearing a conservative but light summer suit."," bitter orange, egyptian basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, australian santalum album",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
862,rose magnetic,Essential Parfums," rose magnetic is a great example of what essential parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. as addictive as its name suggests, rose magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a pierre hermes ispahan macaron.   in the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. in the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of crã¨me patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. a pleasure from top to toe, rose magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple."," grapefruit, peppermint, turkish rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
863,mon vetiver,Essential Parfums," mon vetiver is a surprising and non-traditional vetiver, built on a series of contrasts between bright and dark, natural and synthetic, and modern and traditional, which serve to give this scent a truly distinctive character. balancing its essentially serious character with the cheerful radiance of woody ambers, wearing mon vetiver feels like wearing a savile row suit with the lapels turned up. the structure of mon vetiver is very clever. it drapes a sparkling gin and tonic accord over a dark, woody fougã¨re-ish base for a play of light on dark that really grabs the attention. the rugged masculinity of vetiver is not hidden away or softened, but rather emphasized by the bitterness of lime and a fistful of pungent herbs - lavender and gentian. the play between natural and synthetic is perfectly pitched here too, the earthy sweetness of natural indonesian patchouli illuminated and fluffed out by the sweet, musky glow of cashmeran. woody, earthy, sweet, and expansive, this is a vetiver scent with both manners and swagger."," haitian vetiver, gin accord, mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, indonesian patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
864,nice bergamote,Essential Parfums," nice bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! in fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. the juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. what's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by mother nature herself.  for example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. a buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. it's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. the base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. the tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. if you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then nice bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect."," bergamot, jasmine grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang ylang, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
865,the musc,Essential Parfums," every line needs a musk, and this is the musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. calice becker said she imagined this scentas a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk, and that's a great way to describe its effect. wearing the musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love.   the musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold  it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. but copious amounts of laotian beeswax and australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. these notes  both fresh and warm  are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. nirvanolide and serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur."," ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

871,dent de lait,Serge Lutens," we often look back on milestone events from our childhood with great poignancy, recalling the feeling of innocence and wonder, and the moment that feeling begins to change. dent de lait is just that, a poignant celebration one of our earliest rights of passage during that most magical period of our lives. the loss of one's baby teeth serves as a metaphor for and a harbinger of the inevitable march toward adolescence, and this fragrance captures it with great aplomb. a flash of metallic zing opens bracingly, conjuring the slightly metallic flavor of the void where a baby tooth once roosted. the quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way to a creamy-soft and reassuring smoothness through the deft use of almond milk, coconut and floral aldehydes, transporting you to that moment just before you began to trade your innocence for wisdom.creamy, smooth and ultimately reassuring, this gourmand is imbued with a sense of cloistered security, connecting us to that comforting feeling we enjoyed when we were young."," almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36161.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

873,fougere dargent,TOM FORD Private Blend," fougã¨re d'argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougã¨re, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. with oakmoss no longer available, tom ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with akigalawood, a givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. what emerges from ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine  earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. if there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably fougã¨re d'argent. the aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal savile row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. what marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from gris clair to tom ford's own fucking fabulous will likely love fougã¨re d'argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, fougã¨re d'argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing."," mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, akigalawood, coumarin click here for ingredients ãclose fougere d'argent by tom ford private blend ingredients please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.  please refer to the ingredient list on the product package you receive for the most up to date list of ingredients.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63568.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
874,live in colors,The House Of Oud," the perfect citrus is an elusive thing. pretty much the holy grail of perfumery, in fact. citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. we're happy to report that live in colors pulls it off. it sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. in other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat.  the fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. it smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. the scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. there's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. in the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. live in colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. it's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. but a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us  it just needs to smell fresh and natural. and in that respect, live in colors scores a perfect 10."," lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
875,just before,The House Of Oud," just before revolves around palo santo, the so-calledholy wood burned by the incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. the wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. it smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of palo santo incense  smoky, but with a lively sparkle.  a rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. the contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the hypnotic poison model. but what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmandpatisserie elements. delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, just before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. but because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. sugar and spice and all things nice....just before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest."," bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76423.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

906,erawan,Dusita," erawan is the scent of late summer tipping into fall. it is the smell of the harvest, with fields of aromatic barley, hay, and oats waiting to be brought in, the earthy goodness of nuts, flour, and honey stacked high in the larder, and the wholesome, leaf-brownness of tobacco leaves drying on barn floors. it is not an uncommon theme in indie perfumery, but erawan stands proud of other examples by way of two things. first, dusita's sophisticated style of making perfumes puts a high-definition gloss on the rustic theme, making it the perfect choice for a young paris or new york sophisticate who wants real, but who also wants polished. second, whereas most fragrances with a countryside bent are loaded with syrupy sweetness, booze, or fruit, erawan boasts only the gentle sweetness of nuts, hay, and herbs, thus making it an airy, elegant wear. a series of little contrasts has been cleverly worked into the composition to give the scent texture and movement. there is the herbal brightness of clary sage and petigrain up top, but also a nutty, creamy undercurrent of vetiver to provide depth. liatris, or deertongue, a plant extract that lends perfumes a coumarin-like tone, gives off the scent of freshly-toasted tobacco leaf, but its dry resinousness is nicely offset by the damp, fresh greenery of a surprising muguet note planted in the center. the inky bitterness of oakmoss is suggestive of long shadows under oak trees, but a judicious dose of vanilla softens everything into a delicious, late-afternoon blur. erawan wears like a ray of sunshine on your face. both beautiful and unusual, its rustic charm does not come at the cost of sophistication."," herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, haitian vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
907,fleur de lalita,Dusita," fleur de lalita is a bouquet of tropical flowers that has grown up, moved to france, and taken up smoking and reading baudelaire. peel back the layers and you'll see that its core of lush ylang ylang, tropical lilies, and magnolia remains intact. but bookended by a smoky galbanum up top and salty, lived-in ambergris down below, fleur de lalita is definitely a floral for adults. the playoff between milky sweetness of tropical flowers and the smoky, salty galbanum-ambergris tandem is what makes fleur de lalita such a tour de force. the innocent side of fleur de lalita shows its face first, with a cluster of jasmine, magnolia, and lily so wet and crisp it might have been cut from the garden just moments before. curlicues of buttery ylang ylang snake around the white petals as you bury your face in this bouquet, releasing a steamy tropical undercurrent. but the damp lushness of the flowers is almost immediately cut by a waft of galbanum, a green resin whose smell is pitched halfway between freshly-cut plant stems and smoke. the effect is of being in a tropical garden while someone is smoking an illicit cigarette in a nearby ylang bush, the smoke mingling gently with the creamy flowers. a dash of resinous sandalwood gives the florals and greenery a handsome backbone. but the real payoff comes in the base, when musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris to form a sweet and salty skin-like nuance that will send you over the top. the combination of creamy florals, crisp greenery, smoke, and salty musks in fleur de lalita is simply stunning. this is the fragrance that will make you feel like the best version of yourself, every day of your life."," rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

909,fantastic oud,Montale," what is the true identity of oud? while the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence. this is at the core of fantastic oud, in many ways a culmination of montale's illustrious work with the material, a sumptuous feast for the senses. this rich, nuanced and warm fragrance reveals notes of rose, patchouli, tobacco, incense and styrax that merge with the voluptuous notes of leather, sandalwood and ambergris revealing the rawest character of oud. in other words, it's every facet of oud, masterfully blended together to offer something for everyone in a hypnotically smooth, spicy, rich, warm, fresh, lush, seductive package. whether you're a newcomer to montale's ouds or you own them all, you're sure to fall in love with fantastic oud."," incense, styrax, tobacco, oud, rose, patchouli, leather, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
910,orris tattoo,Parle Moi de Parfum," orris tattoo pays tribute to one of perfumery's most incredible raw materials  orris root. while florists adore the delicate, arching flowers and tall green stems of the iris, perfumers are far more interested in the unprepossessing-looking root underneath. the process of making orris butter is a real labor of love. the iris roots, or rhizomes as they are known, are left to grow underground for three years, and then left to dry out in a cool storeroom for another three years. the result is the most expensive butter you will never find on any supermarket shelf  a silvery substance that chandler burr once referred to asliquid good taste. like pure orris butter itself, orris tattoo smells like the ground and the sky all bound together in one smell. to wit, it smells like bread, violets, eau de vie, suede shoes, cold air, and silky earth. rooty and somewhat fresh at fresh, the scent soon develops a putty-like texture that remains cool to the touch, like chilled butter taken from a florist's fridge. the orris here feels very pure, but it won't make you feel like you're chomping on raw carrots  its purity is gentle, wrapped in a cashmere blanket. this purity is sustained right through to the supple grey suede that develops in the lower registers of the scent. with a material as exquisite as orris root, we pleased to see that orris tattoo resists the temptation to add on too many bells and whistles  apart from a touch of what feels like humid, coconutty sandalwood, cashmere woods, and a hint of violets or heliotrope, this fragrance never really deviates from the orris root hymn sheet. so, if you're looking for the doughy but ethereal pleasures of pure orris, then put orris tattoo on your test list stat.", orris root,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76709.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
911,chypre mojo,Parle Moi de Parfum," in 1917, there was a new shape in the air when coty launched its now legendary chypre de coty. putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. in the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like mitsouko, tabac blond, and pour monsieur. of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). in this post-ifra age, and 100 years on from the launch of chypre de coty, parle-moi de parfum suggests that chypre mojo is what a chypre now looks like. despite the absence of oakmoss, chypre mojo rolls in with all the presence of a properold skool perfume. its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. a bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. chypre mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. while the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. confident, modern, and ebullient, chypre mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo."," bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
912,heritage,Fragrance du Bois," many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when european high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. truly a haute couture scent, heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. a complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. sure, we'll never get to live in paris as it was in the belle epoque, but with heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be."," bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure organic vintage oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
913,vanille benjoin,Affinessence Paris," upon application, vanille benjoin immediately envelops its wearer in a soft, protective cocoon of vanilla that we find insanely comforting. it's a hug in a bottle. the perfumer, an island native herself, helped the brand to source two types of very special vanilla for this scent  the first, a soft, floral tahitian vanilla, and the second, a resinous madagascaran vanilla. the vanillas add a toasty warmth to the scent, as well as a deliciousroundness, but it's worth noting that there's nothing sugary or heavy about vanille benjoin. the vanilla here is dry and woody, tending towards the savory end of the spectrum rather than the sweet.the salty diffusiveness of ambroxan certainly helps to control sweetness, but the main hand in ensuring the scent remains dry is the siam benzoin, the basenote material chosen here to bemarried to the vanilla. although benzoin is roughly analogous to vanilla in that they both add a warm, sweetfullness to the basenotes of a scent, benzoin differs substantially by being far more medicinal, resinous, and spicy-peppery in character. in vanille benjoin, the fiery cinnamon topnotes of benzoin are cleverly matched, step for step, by cedarwood, a material possessed of a similarly spicy, balsamic underbite. in an equally smart move, the doughy, clay-like properties of benzoin are drawn out by a judicious application of tonka bean absolute, which shares with benzoin a buttery texture and nutty aftertaste. vanille benjoin resolves itself in a delicious vanilla suede accord that signals pure luxury and comfort, without any of attendant stodge - powdered sugar diffused in the crisp, cold air of a winter's morning."," tahitian vanilla absolute, madagascan vanilla absolute, siamese benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
914,santal basmati,Affinessence Paris," the deeply fragrant aroma of basmati rice is one of the best smells in the world, and frankly, we're a little surprised it doesn't turn up in more perfumes. in santal basmati, perfumer alexandra carlin, taking her cue from founder sophie broneau's passion for basenotes, cleverly pairs the scent of cooked rice to the most precious and fragrant of woods: mysore sandalwood (s. album), grown sustainably in kerala. why clever? well, you'll notice that basmati rice has a lot in common with sandalwood  they share a certain creaminess, as well as a steamy, nutty undertone akin to grains toasted in butter and cooked long and slow in milk. santal basmati simply identifies the facets they have in common, unites them, and serves us up a bowl of pure bliss. you'd be forgiven for thinking that, given all these milky, woody notes, santal basmati is a rather heavy concoction  but it's really not. a remarkable sleight of hand injects the composition with an airiness that ensures that, while certainly comforting and warming, the scent wears as lightly as a silk cardigan. the sweetness level is nicely judged too, with a buttered popcorn nuance adding a hint of salt, and a supporting framework of woods that stops the scent tipping over completely into rice pudding territory. if you love the triple crã¨me comfort factor of woody gourmands such as santal majuscule (serge lutens), palo santo (carner barcelona), or pralinã© de santal (pierre guillaume), then let us tell you straight: you need some santal basmati in your life."," mysore sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
915,cedre iris,Affinessence Paris," cedre iris is that rare bird  a 100% equal partnership between delicate iris pallida and a material that would normally eat it for breakfast, namely a tough, resinous cedarwood. well, three types of cedarwood, to be exact, the combination of which gives the composition a complex woody profile that darts between smoky, leathery, balsamic, and spicy. but in cedre iris, the tension between the heavy cedarwood and the ephemeral orris is held tight, allowing the cool, waxen orris to float serenely over the very material that would normally subsume it. the payoff of this impressive balancing act is a fragrance that highlights both the exquisitely powdery sheen of iris and the spicy thickness of cedar. iris pallida from florence, which costs $60,000 per kilo, has been used in significant quantities here, so you really feel its presence. but iris cedre is not a monolith. the iris and cedarwood star, for sure, but in time, you will notice that they are supported by elements that cast their own shadows. particularly noticeable is the cinnamon-dusted benzoin that sands down the cedar and orris into a soft blur of incensey, vanillic powder, for dramatic scent trail that's sure to turn heads. but myrrh also plays a significant role here, lending the drydown in particular a crepuscular, almost fungal earthiness that serves to highlight the pale dustiness of the iris. wax, butter, silver, earth, incense, and polished woods  iris cedre truly is the last word in tailored elegance."," cedar (moroccan atlas, texas, virginia), florentine iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
916,patchouli oud,Affinessence Paris," tom waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car""  and patchouli oud by perfumer nicolas bonneville has much the same quality. earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of indonesian and javan jungles, patchouli oud is a study in brown. many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but patchouli oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. the oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. as with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. the smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms patchouli oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit."," oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
917,musc ambre gris,Affinessence Paris," ambergris, the precious sperm whale excretion that's aged for years by the ocean, is the purest essence of the sea. it's an unusual material in perfumery because although it derives from an animal and retains a distinctly animalic character, it also smells mineral, earthy, ozonic, and foresty. in fact, one could say that the scent of ambergris is a microcosm of nature's bounty in full. ambergris is something of a shapeshifter in perfumery, though  it's suggestible. in musc ambre gris, the perfumer has nudged the natural ambergris towards a saltier, woodsier interpretation than some of the sweeter, more amber-focused compositions in the genre. what's striking about this fragrance is that it smells completely organic, as if it were ripped from nature and not made in a lab. it encompasses all the wind-chafed aromas of a desolate beach in winter, ranging from desiccated driftwood, crushed seashells, and minerals to the inky bitterness of marine lichen. musc ambre gris smells vivid and wild, its smoky tangle of sea grasses (vetiver), yerba mate, and sharp black musk with its creosote-like tang all pulling together to emphasize the raspy, masculine-leaning character of the scent. in the far drydown, earthy patchouli and white truffle add a fungal depth that accentuates the salt-flat brininess of the ambergris. a perfume of scorched earth, musc ambre gris has the brooding intensity of a young brando- not to mention the undeniable seductiveness."," amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
918,cuir curcuma,Affinessence Paris," the first fragrance in the world to use natural extract of turmeric, cuir curcuma is a strikingly different kind of leather fragrance. neither a russian nor a spanish (moorish) leather, but rather, an indian leather, it rises like a phoenix from the clay attar stills and tanning yards of kannauj, where ancient ayurvedic principles of balance in all things still reigns supreme. cuir curcuma is fine leather cured with lots of earthy golden spice and hot milk, for a result that's unusual enough to be distinctive but delicious enough to be comforting.  cuir curcuma cleverly plays on the theme of a traditional indian drink called golden milk, an ayurvedic tonic taken in india to cleanse the bloodstream and balance all doshas. this golden elixir balances the iodic bitterness of turmeric with the sweet creaminess of whole milk, pulverized almonds, sugar, and pistachios. you'll find that the same push-pull betweeneat me anddon't eat me carried through to the fragrance itself. the crazy-delicious lactones thrown off by the sandalwood create asteamed milk effect similar to the one in santal basmati, but here it is spicier - woods cooked down with resin until the bottom layer catches and caramelizes. it smells incredibly tasty, but also tasteful, a sprinkle of salty, anisic myrrh stopping the scent from straying too far into gourmandise. cuir curcuma is a scent full of drama, its inky medicinal notes making you sit up and take notice. sweepingly exotic, yet seductively cozy, this is the leather jacket you never thought you could pull off, and now can't live without."," turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
919,hwyl,Aesop," smoky, woodsy, completely compelling, hwyl is an explorer's journey into the heart of the eternal forest as only aesop could present it. combining gorgeously smooth cedarwood and seductively sexy incense- lovers of cdg hinoki and incense kyoto should clear a spot on the shelf right now- hwyl adds an intriguing element of depth with an intense base of vetiver that showcases grassy and spicy facets with equal aplomb. it's a fragrance that feels both natural and supernatural, as if one is in tune with the deeper secrets of an ancient wood- and yet, that sense of peace and wisdom coexists perfectly with an undeniable sensuality- this is sexy, smoky incense the likes of which we haven't encountered in a while. get lost in the forest with hwyl- you'll be glad you did."," cypress, frankincense, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30155.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
920,tempo,Diptyque," all too often,  patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""it's patchouli, "" the refrain goes,  ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" tempo,  the wonderful new patchouli scent from diptyque,  defies such simple-minded rejection- after all,  it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by tempo's complex,  gorgeous subtlety,  which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet,  delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven,  yet undeniably sophisticated.by building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced,  ethically-harvested varieties of indonesian patchouli,  olivier pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy,  woodsy,  spicy and sweet,  all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. this careful balance is further enhanced with lively,  green violet leaf and nutty,  spicy mate,  which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans,  give tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again."," bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
921,fleur de peau,Diptyque," as part of diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, fleur de peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? by wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, fleur de peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.the musks at the core of fleur de peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. a beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. all together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. it's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for diptyque's 50th anniversary? musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived."," aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

942,impressions de giverny,Fort & Manle," impressions de giverny is a scentscape inspired by monet's famous gardens at giverny. the artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a livingen plein air version of his paintings, and so he did. the fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the giverny garden: first, the famous japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in monet's nymphã©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. in other words, impressions de giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. the way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. the scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native japanese fruits and flora. but almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. there's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. at the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat  a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. we're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. if you loved confessions of a garden gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling impressions de giverny a priority."," yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

961,tsuki,Di Ser," tsuki, meaningmoon, is a wild green scent that captures the thrilling unfamiliarity of japanese herbs and aromatics. imagine crushing the leaves of some strange herb between your fingers in the dark and not knowing what it is, exactly. the minty, rosy sting of geranium is clearly identifiable, but you also smell something like crushed lemon balm and coriander beneath that. the aroma is green, minty, herbaceous, citrusy, and also gin-like thanks to a generous dose of juniper berry. but perhaps the most defining feature here is the fresh, vegetal scent of fennel, which gives the background of the scent a lingering anisic sweetness.  strangely enough, even if you've never been to japan or smelled japanese herbs and aromatics before, there is something that marks this scent out as clearly japanese, rather than chinese or indian - possibly its sense of delicacy and restraint. after a bold start, the scent whittles down into a shadowy trace of powdered ginger and licorice root that, although not loud in volume, remains a gentling presence that calms and focuses the mind throughout the day. with its energizing and uplifting qualities, tsuki is truly a health tonic in scent form: we can imagine it being doled out in therapeutic doses by doctors to tired, stressed-out patients. detox from the noise of modern life with this wonderful little elixir."," geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
962,"feb 14, 1912",Rundholz Parfums," warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. a distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. and in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral. refined and understated, yet complex and deeply resonant, feb.14, 1912 is unmistakably a rundholz creation- and also unlike anything they've offered before."," orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
963,sasora,Di Ser," sasora, like all other fragrances in the di ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the kodo ceremony, the art oflistening to japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild hindi oud brought out of the jungles of assam, in northern india, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the arabian peninsula. the sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. however, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in sasora, the perfume.the citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a zen-like state of bliss. the citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the himalayas. both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a japanese forest. considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional japanese incense sticks. and indeed, sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from shoyeido and baieido  herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. the rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. real oud oil from noble assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu  this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office."," yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
964,kyara,Di Ser," japanese treatment of agarwood in perfumery is completely different from that of middle-eastern perfumery, so let's take a minute to re-set expectations. since the 6th century ad, the japanese have used kyara agarwood in the kodo ceremony (the way of incense), which is the art oflistening to scent. kyara is a very special type of agarwood. it refers to wood from extremely old, wild-grown agarwood trees in mostly vietnam, now rare to the point of being extinct. the wordkyara is a description of a scent profile, but also used in grading to mean the highest quality of agarwood. most authentic kyara pieces were sold to private collectors in japan, which is how di ser came into possession of its own small collection of the precious wood. kyara is normally heated gently over ash and mica plates as incense; due to its rarity and scarcity, it is never used for distilling oud oil. until now, that is. in an unprecedented move, di ser took the decision to distill oil from its own private collection of kyara. this was an enormously bold and risky undertaking, considering the expense of the raw material, the tiny yield, and the difficulty in extracting oil from such densely-resinated wood. most oud oil fanatics will never have smelled genuine kyara, either in oil or incense form, so this fragrance, kyara, is literally the opportunity of a lifetime. the holy grail of oud.  kyara has a uniquely resinous, green aroma when burned, said to be calming and transporting in equal measure. the opening notes of this 100% natural fragrance are, in fact, pure kyara  verdant, minty, and slightly antiseptic, with the evergreen sting of camphor. although recognizably oud, the note is as vaporous and clean as early morning mist in a japanese forest -never dirty or smoky. a massive, gauzy rose note swells up behind the green kyara opening, fleshing out the kyara into a luminous rose-oud concerto against a spicy-woody backdrop that feels like powdered ginger root diffused in sunlight. in keeping with the japanese classification of oud as rokkoku gomi (meaning ""of six countries"" and the bitter taste fromthe five tastes of sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty), the sweetness and powder is kept in check by the peppery, balsamic-vinegar underbite typical of vietnamese agarwood. if you've grown weary of oud or simply dislike the more animalic, arabic treatment of the material, then re-set your nose and give yourself a treat with kyara, the japanese silk screen of the oud world. di ser's kyara represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smell authentic kyara agarwood in liquid form  do not cheat yourself of this experience!"," kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
965,hasunoito,Di Ser," hasunoito is based on the lotus flower, the symbol of di ser and revered throughout japan, india, and most eastern asian countries for its spiritual significance. the oil of both white and pink lotus is so costly and rare that di ser has chosen to focus mostly on the abstract idea of a lotus blossom shooting up through the soil, displaying the duality of strength and softness so characteristic of the flower.  and indeed, the first half of the perfume puts forth a convincing portrait of earth. the specific type of agarwood used here smells like cold, damp clay, with a fuzzy golden haze of something medicinal, like flowers dipped into an antiseptic ointment. boronia absolute, used only in the most luxurious of all-natural perfumery, lends a fresh, spicy-fruity accent, like purple berries doused in wintergreen and clove. despite the presence of lotus, rose, ylang, and jasmine, nothing about this perfume reads as floral in tone; rather, it smells like a pleasantly earthy, spicy tea filtered through hospital gauze. arresting, different, and ultimately kind of addictive, hasunoito is for people who wish to access higher planes of spirituality without going through the more hackneyed route of incense and flowers."," agarwood (oud), sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
966,akanesasu,Di Ser," akane sasu sora,  a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. it's a phrase imbued with splendor,  suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm,  with awe-inspiring results. to be certain,  a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power,  the same energy,  the same reverence. luckily,  this eye-openingly bright,  joyous and rich ode to citrus,  jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. as if to mirror the color progression of a sunset,  akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot,  where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit,  mouthwatering and energizing. a rich,  fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty,  and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth,  leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains,  leaving the sky painted red. a fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation,  akanesasu is poetry in a bottle."," orange, bergamot, jasmine sambac, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
967,shiragoromo,Di Ser," shiragoromo is an amalgamation of two words, shira (meaning white) and goromo (meaning cloth). white is a sacred color in japan, even appearing as the main color on the japanese flag, because it stands for purity and childlike innocence. the fragrance itself also smells clean and pure. predominantly a simple, natural blend of bright yuzu and earthy green woods, shiragoromo manages to give the feel of a sun-dappled citrus grove that is nonetheless clearly a japanese citrus grove.  the opening is both sweet and medicinal - oranges and yuzu with the antiseptic bitterness of green aloeswood lurking directly beneath. the purity of the di ser approach to perfumery shines through strongly here and great thought has been given to the balance of all five taste elements of japanese culture: sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty. it takes a long time for the floral elements to break free of the grip of medicinal yuzu and earthy woods, but finally a clean, radiant white jasmine steps out into the clearing. that the flower feels like an extension of the citrus and woods is testament to both the skill of the perfumer and the delicacy of the jasmine oil used here. if you like the idea of white flower petals filtered through damp, earthy green woods and exuberant citrus, then look to shiragoromo. it's the rare white floral that doesn't actually behave or smell like one; glimpsed at an oblique angle and shaped into something new by the other materials, shiragoromo feels like a fresh take on a much-traveled theme."," agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
968,suleyman le magnifique,Fort & Manle," the longest-reigning sultan of the ottoman empire, suleyman i presided over the empire's golden age, marked by massive conquest and expansion, cutting edge political and societal reform, and some of the world's greatest artistic and cultural output- to say nothing of his legendary, passionate love for his wife roxelana, elevated from his harem to be his queen in bold defiance of tradition and convention. this is the man rasei fort pays tribute to with suleyman le magnifique, a fragrance that celebrates the sultan's dynamic complexity by blending notes both softly sweet and ferociously animalic. an amalgamation of florals, spice, incense and resin, it's a powerfully irresistible ode to the opulence of an illustrious empire, contrasting bitter-green galbanum against syrupy amber, earthy patchouli with juicy red apple and fiery cinnamon, all against a backdrop of deep, animalic oud. luxurious, sumptuous and sophisticated, suleyman le magnifique is a truly fitting homage to one of history's great figures."," galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
969,charlatan,Fort & Manle," from our very first encounter, fort & manle has blown us away with their ability to tell wonderfully targeted stories with their scents- tales where the fragrances themselves go far beyond ""matching the mood"" of the copy and become genuine narratives in their own right. charlatan, a tale of seduction, deception, betrayal, and sin, is by these standards truly a masterwork. opening with sweetly soft, romantic pear dipped in luscious chocolate, the opening notes evoke a gentle and charming courtship. even as an element of carnality is introduced via black perigord truffle, it builds into a passionate symphony of damascene rose and a lush supporting floral cast, a flirtation exploded into a full-blown romance. only as a deeply earthy amber and surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter the picture do we see the twist- an element of danger has saturated our storybook, and the elaborate bouquet may contain poison at the center. but then again, some lovers thrive on the edge. sweet and soft, dark and dangerous, charlatan is an incredibly creative scent that you'll enjoy experiencing as much as those around you."," pear, chocolate, perigord truffle, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, vanilla bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
970,confessions of a garden gnome,Fort & Manle," one does not often consider the humble nobility of the garden gnome, and yet his stoicism in the face of the ever-changing seasons is, in its own way, quite beautiful. confessions of a garden gnome pays tribute to this stalwart steward of your backyard, whisking us through a whimsically enchanting year's worth of weather in a single spray, an experience that proves to be as creative and delightful as any we've had in niche fragrance. confessions opens in springtime, a crisp, green breeze of yuzu-inflected bergamot atop a dewey musk. summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris. ultimately, the darkening wood notes lead into winter, while glowing amber suggests the warmth and comfort lurking just out of reach of our heroic gnome, frozen as he is to his territory. it's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, an ever-evolving fragrant experience that must be worn to be believed. mister gnome, we salute you."," cedar, musk, sicilian bergamot, coriander, yuzu, pink pepper, lily of the valley, mango, rose, violet leaf, ambergris, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
971,amber absolutely,Fort & Manle," amber fragrances are often associated with warmth, comfort, and beauty- but can an amber be dangerous? in the hands of rasei fort- absolutely. here, the dynamic new nose behind fort & manle envisions amber as a trap, a seduction, glowing so brightly that those drawn to its light cannot realize they've become the prey... until it's too late. don't get us wrong- this is one of the most delicious, warm and downright rapturous ambers we've experienced- rich, resinous labdanum, spiked with benzoin, sweetened with a golden honey and juicy plum. but an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected. amber lovers, you'll fall head over heels for this rich, creative and ferocious elixir. and those who normally shy away from dessert-sweet amber scents- maybe it's time to try an amber with some fangs."," musk, amber, benzoin, labdanum, honey, plum, rose, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
972,fatih sultan mehmed,Fort & Manle," a tribute to the opulence and glory of the ottoman sultanic empire, fatih sultan mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of mehmed the conqueror. crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental. ambergris lovers, we recommend getting your hands on this scent today- put simply, fatih sultan mehmed smells like a million bucks."," bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
973,harem rose,Fort & Manle," a soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? with harem rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the damascene rose that rasei fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. the result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose. if you love fresher, gentler roses but don't want to smell like a teenager, great news: harem rose beckons."," amber, benzoin, vanilla, rose, cashmere woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
974,maduro,Fort & Manle," in 1961, a cuban cargo ship, the reina del mar, was intercepted by barbadian pirates on its way to the united states. the ship was scuttled in the ocean and its cargo- tropical fruits and, more importantly, a crate of rare, priceless cohiba maduro cigars- sank to the bottom of the ocean. with maduro, fort & manle reimagine the deep, intoxicating aroma of that cargo hold as an explosion of herbaceous spice, fruit, and rich tobacco, a smoky-sweet woody gourmand with unparalleled depth. clean, vibrant fruit and spice collide with rich, resinous amber, earthy patchouli is smoothed with warm vanilla and woods, and at the center, an intriguingly complex tobacco- dry and spicy one moment, sweet and musty the next. the reina del mar may have shipwrecked, but maduro, the fragrance it inspired, is a magnificent vessel indeed."," basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, atlas cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
975,bojnokopff,Fort & Manle," an extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution russia's master illusionists, bojnokopff (formerly titled mr. bojnokopff's purple hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean french lavender. as the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. as the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. who is the mysterious mr. bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?"," oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
976,slowdive,Hiram Green Perfumes," is the name of hiram green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to slowdive, the seminal uk shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? the perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the indian summer air is almost palpable."" but it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. this is the feeling of slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. the result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of hiram green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. while the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve."," neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
977,baque,Slumberhouse," we'd heard talk of baque, a long-discontinued slumberhouse original that pre-dated our relationship with josh lobb's tantalizing creations, but truth be told, we weren't too worried about it. how could a different slumberhouse tobacco scent steal our hearts away from the mouthwatering fruit-laced smoking pipe of kiste, or the smoky-sweet darkness of (dearly departed) jeke? but now, baque is, well, back, and we're delighted to discover that it's a dynamic, vividly-painted tobacco scent that lands squarely in the middle of our two previous favorites. combining syrupy, fruity apricot with sweet, spicy tobacco and a deep strain of boozy richness, baque hypnotizes and delights, seduces and compels, and most importantly, draws us deep within an vivid, gorgeous imaginary landscape as only slumberhouse can."," apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
978,camel,Zoologist," camel is a series of elegant contradictions. technically, it's an oriental, but in sidestepping all of the clichã©s of the genre, it retains a surprisingly brisk, fat-free mien. it features a plethora of rich, sticky notes like dates and dried fruit, but is as dry as a glass of champagne. frankincense, musk, and oud lend a sinuous exoticism that speaks to the east; yet camel has a distinctly retro flourish that places it firmly among the flanks of classic french perfumes such as my sin and arpege. we sense several shifting layers of scent in camel, all of them fascinating. first, a topnote of dried fruit dipped in green frankincense sets the pace: resinous, rich, but also dry, tart almost. imagine the steamy sweetness of dried apricots and plums laid out in a souk, pricked by the waxy sourness of preserved lemons and pickled mangoes just beneath. the mouthwatering notes of the opening give way to an animalic floral heart  a none-too-clean jasmine and orange blossom whipped into a soapy, leathery froth by civet and musk. all this is spread over a gritty amber drydown that manages to smell like the friction between hot sand, cold soap, and silk sheets. although camel strikes us as more madame bovary than scheherazade, it nonetheless manages to capture the contradictory nature of the camel, itself permanently poised between froideur and rage."," dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
979,day dreams,Montale," like the warm summer nights in greece, where the daylight is endless and the air is ripe with flowers. montale's whisper-soft day dreams is about what is left when all cares melt away. a juicy burst of mandarin opens up a romantic whirlwind of white flowers - neroli, jasmine, orange blossom - and a tropical hit of tiare. as it all floats along a fluffy cloud of vanilla and coconut, the sensual, musky fragrance proves its worth as truly a dream come true."," orange blossom, jasmine, mandarin, neroli, tiare, sandalwood, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35483.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

982,ummagumma,Bruno Fazzolari," as a multi-sensory artist, bruno fazzolari's creations pulse with the energy of magical realms, from the blazing glow of feu secret to the crackling fluorescents of room 237. but with ummagumma, fazzolari ushers us into his darkest, sultriest locale yet- a languorous world of rich gourmand notes that flow with indulgently deliberate sweetness- aromatic, smooth tobacco, resinous labdanum, creamy vanilla and sandalwood- and foremost of all, a mouthwateringly warm, rich chocolate note, sweet and robust without a drop of fake sugar. this is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old. perhaps it's not right to call it a gourmand at all- it's a portal to yet another world that defies too-simple categorization while at the same time feeling immeasurably appropriate for the one category it firmly falls into- that of an original bruno fazzolari creation. chocolate lovers, winter adventurers, and all who appreciate original art- don't miss ummagumma."," saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
983,black vanilla,Mancera," black vanilla by mancera is a milky floral vanilla that soothes rather than challenges, which is exactly what we all need every now and then. soft hints of blackcurrants, coconut, and peach cast a gauzy veil of fruit over the vanilla accord, itself sheer and barely sweet, like coconut milk put through a milk frother. the juicy berries and peach lend a discreetly flirtatious vibe, but in general, the lack of syrupy sweetness marks this out as a refined, grown-up vanilla scent.  in time, a powdery rose emerges from the peachy, berried vanilla froth, creamy puffs of jasmine petals and candied violet trailing soon after. the florals, diffused in an enormous cloud of soapy white musk, feel more like a swirl of expensive cosmetic powder than freshly-cut flowers, giving the scent a distinctly clean, feminine vibe. in terms of sillage and longevity, black vanilla lasts the day, but is soft rather than loud. despite the name, therefore, black vanilla is truly a perfect fragrance for days when you need your scent to stay low-key but still smell amazing. gently feminine, its cluster of powdery flowers, musk, and lightly frothed vanilla-coconut milk feels more like a perfect veil of milky, floral lotion rather than a full-on perfume."," bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
984,red tobacco,Mancera," red tobacco by mancera is an incredibly potent, sexy tobacco fragrance with enough spice to turn the heat up on a cold winter's night. the opening is deceptively sharp and fresh, a one-two punch of leathery saffron and crisp apple, bathed in a haze of that smoky, medicinal mancera oud. this phase smells like oud chips fermenting in a vat of honey  medicinal, slightly pungent, and deliciously sweet-n-sour. but it's not long before the scent shakes off any semblance of freshness and melts into a thick, juicy amber that smells like a river of molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco, dried plums, and fruitcake. red tobacco is so confidently spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon, it practically sizzles. with time, the sweet, rich pipe tobacco emerges from its bed of amber and spice to reveal itself as the true star. the bombastic sweetness of the scent is toned down a little by the slightly dirty, smoky oud note and a patchouli note that smells like damp dark chocolate. a naughty little cousin to montale's honey aoud, red tobacco will warm your bones in winter and the blood of anyone who picks up your scent."," saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, haitian vetiver, madagascar vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

988,mx,ERIS Parfums," pronouncedmix, mx. is named after the gender neutral title replacing mr., mrs. and ms., announces a new gender fluid era where perfumes are not rigidly gendered. ""x"" marks the spot of freedom.true to form, mx. doesn't abstain from taking a position on gender  it leaves all options open. mx. dances between sweet creaminess and brusque, aromatic woods, playing both sides of the fence with perfect poise and balance. its mouthwatering, almost gourmand opening salvo of peppery saffron fits neatly over a heart of rugged australian sandalwood and cedar spiked with black pepper, ginger, cacao and frankincense.dabs of castoreum and birch tar in the base draw all the other notes together in a sensual embrace, sending a haze of smoke and leather up through the nutty, earthy sandalwood. a crã¨me brulã©e of whipped woods, saffron, incense, and smoke, mx. is the fragrance equivalent of a soft feminine face being kissed all over by a masculine, stubbled one. we defy you to put it on and not shiver with pleasure."," indian ginger, madagascar black pepper, saffron, ethiopian olibanum, australian sandalwood, virginian cedarwood, haitian vetiver, indonesian patchouli, laotian benzoin, russian birch tar, venezuelan cacao, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
989,monstera,Xinu," monstera pays tribute to the scent of monstera deliciosa (delicious monster), a lush plant native to the tropical rainforests of southern mexico. although monstera produces fruit, the focus here is on the green, aromatic scent of the leaves, stem, and plant itself.when talking about green scents, it's important to define the type of greenness  green perfumes can smell vegetal, herbaceous, bitter, dewy, bitter, or waxy depending on the notes used. what's astonishing about monstera is just how juicy and lush the greenery smells here, like a leaf that's been snapped open, allowing great big droplets of plant juice and sap to seep out. the scent supports the crunchy greenery with an accord that smells like damp earth, bitter moss, and the sharpness of a pineapple-like note from the monstera fruit. in its final movement, orchid and datura lend a subtly creamy white floral tone, the orchid in particular giving the scent a hint of bitter cocoa and vanilla. but in general, the aromatic greenery of a mexican jungle is what lingers here, both in the mind and on the skin. monstera is a leafy green scent that never once loses its focus, for a result that's both beautiful and technically impressive."," leaves and fruit of monstera, sacred ear flowers, white datura, bullhorn orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
990,oronardo,Xinu," oronardo is a word that combines two spanish words: nardo, which means tuberose, the famously fleshy white flower that's native to mexico, and oro, meaning gold, hence oronardo (golden tuberose).being both mexican and famous for his lyrical treatment of white florals, it is no surprise that rodrigo flores-roux is able to pay proper tribute to the gorgeous mexican tuberose. first, he flanks the tuberose with a very indolic mock orange - a sweet-smelling white flower that smells like jasmine petals dipped in honey  to accentuate its naturally fleshy sexiness. then he draws out its green, camphoraceous freshness through judicious use of marigold, a spicy, herbaceous flower with a twinge of vegetal bitterness. the result captures the totality of the freshly-plucked flower  tuber, stems, petals, leaves and all. the texture of oronardo is also a delight, transitioning gracefully from whipped cream to a breeze of golden, pollinated powder. delicate and green rather than heavy, oronardo shows that, in the right hands, tuberose doesn't have to be the show-stopping monster it's often reputed to be."," mock orange, floral notes, marigold, tuberose, white nerium oleander",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
991,fumabat,Couteau de Poche," fumabat: an unusual name for unusual perfume. parid cefa takes familiar materials  pine, carnation, frankincense, patchouli  and rearranges them in a novel way that that you don't smell what you're expecting to smell. expectations are upended. for example, despite the presence of mint, green tea, and galbanum in the topnotes, fumabat is neither green nor particularly fresh.instead, it's a tarry spice oriental with a big old school drydown of oakmoss, patchouli, and soapy leather. surprised that fragrances with such throwback appeal are being produced in small artist's ateliers in brooklyn? yeah, so are we. in a good way. for all its retro style, fumabat feels exciting and new. we are taken on a dizzyingly ride from spicy carnation, oakmoss, and galbanum, which appear to reference classic perfumery, to exotic, smoky frankincense, which brings us straight to the sultan's harem, and even detouring briefly to a grungy, 1970's style patch. somehow, fumabat manages to pull everything together brilliantly, as if perfumery had always been missing a vital piece of the puzzle  arabian nights meets burt reynolds  and this brand stepped in to provide it."," green tea, galbanum, mint absolute, bulgarian black pine, carnation, somalian frankincense, vetiver root, leather, oakmoss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
992,aguamadera,Xinu," aguamadera is an amalgamation of two words in spanish: agua for water, and madera for wood, thus aguamadera meaningwaterwood. this name makes sense when you consider that this is a scent based on the scent of agave, a tough succulent native to mexico whose hard, spiky leaves give us both agave syrup and mezcal. the mezcal theme is fully explored in aguamadera, with a lime note up top that's so tart it almost draws saliva from the mouth. there's a hit of salt with an outdoorsy freshness that recalls a gust of sea air. all this might be written off as just another riff on a summer freshie were it not for the incredible woody notes that form the ballast of the scent   guaiac wood gives the scent the smokey agave spirit of mezcal, and cedarwood a nuance of sweat-lodge coziness that lends enormous charm and warmth. the woods are more creamy than dry or radiant, which works exceptionally well against the spikier salt and citrus notes. if you're in the market for a tangy, citrusy fragrance with a natural, non-abrasive woody drydown that goes on forever, then aguamadera should be on your radar."," agave, lime, guaiac wood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
993,copala,Xinu," copala focuses on copal resin, used as incense by the indigenous peoples of mexico and central america since the time of the mayan civilization. black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. here, it is the good-natured sweetness of mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. the faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. what's most impressive about copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the xinãº rendition is positively monastic."," pink pepper, copal, mesquite, mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

995,french affair,Ex Nihilo," french affair pays tribute to the fiercely elegant chypres of paris in the 1970's  earthy, mossy affairs worn by the free-thinkers of the world who strolled through the left bank like they owned it. and they did. women in le smoking tuxedos unbuttoned to the navel, men in full-on oscar wilde mode: nonconformists who smelled of gauloises smoke, crushed velvet, and aramis 900. but french affair is no nu-chypre pretender. it is authentically, damply, unmistakably oakmoss-y, with that familiar inky feel that gives chypres their backbone. a rich wave of indonesian patchouli - earthy and camphoraceous - jumps out at you from the topnotes, riding hand in hand with the moss to create an accord of coppery, freshly-turned soil. the lychee note smells more like overripe plum, momentarily sweetening the earthier notes. violet leaf streaks across the loamy gloom, as surprising as a camera flash. but the dark, musty earth notes are what prevail  a bolt of black velvet unfolded after many years in storage. eventually, this accord reveals a spiced, plummy rose and a pungent cedary drydown that is both aromatic and slightly sweaty. french affair stands shoulder to shoulder with the great patchouli chypres of the 1970's, aramis 900, aromatics elixir, and givenchy gentleman. close your eyes and breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke floating through velvet collars soaked in patchouli. dark, moody, and viciously sexy, french affair is indeed a very french affair."," bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, atlas cedar, angelica, pepper, indonesian patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1005,bruma,Cire Trudon," bruma meanssolstice in latin, which brings to mind something one might wear to a pagan ritual or to howl at the moon. but the word bruma' is also close to the french word brume for mist, and we think that this word fits the scent better. it begins with a gentle misting of iris, violets, and peony, all swirled together into a creamy, fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum, part lipstick. a rooty iris stands at the center, quietly gathering itself up into a soft leather, aided by black pepper, which accentuates the naturally rubbery facets of peony. thanks to a touch of lavender and galbanum, the suede or leather accord grows ashier, greener, and drier, the ghost of tuscan leather flickering at the edges. it is only after a while that one begins to notice the delicious creaminess of the base coming forward: damp jasmine petals pressed into spicy, milky tonka bean and the saltwater taffy of labdanum. all the while, bruma retains a delightfully gauzy texture, which makes it an easy wear, even in hot weather. the lingering impression is of a fruity violet suede accord over dry ash, resin, and finally, the nutty, baked hay smell of tonka and vetiver. it is not the striding valkyrie implied by the name; but for days when you want to smell just plain amazing rather than fierce, bruma is the perfect choice."," black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55965.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1006,ii (deux),Cire Trudon," ii, or deux (french for two), is all about new beginnings: the second act, rebirth, regeneration. essentially, deux is an aromatic scent filled to brimming with the piercingly green smell of regrowth  fig saplings, plants, and young conifers pushing their way up through layers of humus and pine needles to meet the sun. with lots of aromatic juniper and bitter orange, it is brisk and unsentimental, an impression confirmed by its salty, woody musk in the drydown. like all the perfumes in the cire trudon range, it is perfectly unisex. although not listed, we smell a lot of kitchen garden notes in here too, particularly the resinous snap of tomato leaf, mint, basil, and the milky juice of fresh fig leaf. the vibrant, stemmy smell of crushed leaves is intoxicating, bringing back memories of small, childish hands stained green with plant juice. this is a scent that crawls with life. wearing it, you can almost sitting in a forest clearing, face turned to the sun, surrounded by the fertile smell of tender green shoots and leaves pushing up to the surface, like a fast motion sequence on a nature documentary. deux is the perfect fragrance with which to welcome in the rites of spring and drive away the cold stoniness of winter. bristling with verdant energy, think of deux as a shot of antioxidant-rich green juice to stimulate the blood and re-start the engine."," green leaves, orange bigarade, pine, pepper, juniper, cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55966.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1007,mortel,Cire Trudon," mortel proves there's a reason why incense has been burned in churches for thousands of years: it just smells darned good. yes, incense is used to purify the air and to rid places of worship of bad spirits. but the truth of the matter is that the scent of frankincense, labdanum, myrrh, and benzoin is almost universally pleasing. the question then becomes how to build an incense fragrance in a way that it stands out from countless others in the genre. some use room-filling synthetics to lift the resins, some are dense and airless, and some are airy, bright  almost soapy. mortel is a bone-dry, monastic take on the theme, differing from other entries in the field by being both wearable (in a casual, everyday sense) and supremely natural in feel. it skips entirely the lime-peel brightness of the topnotes of frankincense, plunging instead directly towards a heart of dark, waxy, smoked-out resin, with a vein of sizzling black pepper. the structure stacks churchy resins around a core of extremely dry labdanum, which here completely lacks the friendlier caramelic tones of its usual presentation. myrrh, licorice-like and earthy, is particularly prominent, its dark oiliness underlined by a generous helping of nutmeg, pimento, and pepper. the toasty tones of virginia cedar form a bridge between the dusty cistus in the heart to the powdery benzoin in the far dry-down. but, although mortel is undeniably dry and austere, its dryness is organic, like the natural dustiness of soot or charcoal. calming and meditative, it is an incense that will elevate the spirit without grinding the wearer down. believe us, that's a hard balance to strike, and in our opinion, mortel nails it."," black pepper, pimento, nutmeg, frankincense, virginia cedar, cistus, myrrh and benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55967.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1008,olim,Cire Trudon," olim, latin for once', is supposed to evoke the excess and vanity of the french court under king louis. and indeed, this is one pompadour of a fragrance, full of glittering powder, resin, golden bergamot, exotic spice, and intimate musks. breathing this in, one might imagine the powdered wigs and sugary petit fours of marie antoinette, as well as the aromatic lavender waters splashed on by courtiers after their evening toilette. it is glittering, bold, and full-figured  an oriental with its corset stays loosened.we begin at the afternoon tea table of the young queen and her adoring coquettes. a golden bergamot is doused heavily in powdered sugar, turning it from tart to fizzy and sweet: a lemon sherbet in fragrance form. aromatic herbs in the heart sparkle  dewy lavender and anise, turning the air violet as the gentlemen drench their wigs and clothes to freshen them. but there is something sensual and skin-like underneath the bright elements, a combination of creamy musk, clove, and patchouli giving the lavender and bergamot a naughty jicky edge. the deliberate clashing of citrus and cream, aromatics and resin, well  that's the classic recipe for when you want to do an oriental right. and olim gets it right. if you love the warm sexiness of big-boned orientals such as shalimar, musc ravageur, and opus 1144, then olim ought to give you a thrill."," bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55968.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1009,revolution,Cire Trudon," inspired by the chaos in the streets of paris during the french revolution, revolution is a fragrance full of the smells of danger  the peppery smoke of gunpowder mingling with raging fire, leather riding boots, and spilled musket oil. such accords have the potential to come off as harsh or extreme, but in the experienced hands of british perfumer lyn harris, they convey the excitement of battle with a buttery smoothness that makes the scent a breeze to wear. so we have rugged, ashy leather and the sooty smoke from burned-out houses, but with a creamy elemi underpinning that immediately softens the punch. cade oil muscles its way past the buttery leather, filling the nostrils with its intensely green-black, smoky smell. adding to the powerful impression of chaos created by the opening, a peppery papyrus combines with dusty cedar to create a searing flash of gunpowder from a newly-spent musket. together, these notes conjure up the image of a young soldier, taking temporary shelter in a burned-out house on the champs-ãlysã©es, the searing smell of soot, ash, singed leather boots, and gunpowder softened by the creamy smell of ancient cedar bookcases, sheaves of paper, and the whiff of incense from a nearby church. and it's this juxtaposition between burned and creamy elements that gives the scent its power to soothe and excite at the same time.  revolution is the smell of the vestiges of civilization meeting the approaching fires of the crusaders."," elemi, angelica, cedar, papyrus, patchouli, cade, incense, cistus, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55969.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1010,oud satin mood,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," of the many fragrances to attempt to reinterpret oud for the western palette, very few have been as much a runaway success as francis kurkdjians oud satin mood, a gorgeously textured, impossibly smooth tapestry of delicate spice, elegant florals, and mouthwatering vanilla layered with an exquisite specimen of pure laotian oud. now, for the first time ever, this sumptuous delight is available in a sinfully concentrated extrait de parfum, where the rose (now a decadent combination of turkish and bulgarian roses) is lusher, the vanilla creamier, and the oud richer and smoother than ever before. a holy grail for oud and gourmand lovers alike, oud satin mood extrait might be the most deliciously sensual scent to ever emerge from francis kurkdjian's magical workshop."," agarwood, bulgarian rose, benzoin, turkish rose, violet and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49874.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1011,woman in gold,By Kilian," the austrian mona lisa glows not with an ambiguous smile, but in gorgeous golden patterns, motifs, and flushed rosy cheeks. gustav klimt's 1907 portrait of adele bloch-bauer is one of the most famous of his erotic gold-leaf paintings. by kilian's woman in gold conjures a similar sensuality and play between light and shadow through a delicate rose as seen through unctuous vanilla and exquisite woods. woman in gold glows from the onset, with a tart bergamot and ripe mandarin, blended into soft-focus by a warm vanillic tonka bean. a sweet silken rose slowly blooms, petals lifting, whipped to a velvety froth, but with a darkness within, hinted at by gentle layers of oud and patchouli, seamlessly adjoined. the result is a perfume as complex and dazzling as the woman who wears it."," bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1012,gold knight,By Kilian," inspired by the dashing, golden-armored chevalier in gustav klimt's 1902 beethoven frieze, by kilian's gold knight flows with a similar golden opulence. the dark sensuousness of patchouli is draped in deep, golden honey, as kilian hennessy is wont to do. but despite the gourmand connotations, a fresh anisic bite adds an invigorating masculine edge for the gold knight - most distinctively paired with a bright, dry bergamot in the opening. as the scent grows darker, the honeyed patchouli shimmers with cinnamon, vanilla, and anise into a warm, sexy powerhouse.a magnificent collector's edition coffret, beautifully embellished in homage to artist gustav klimt's unique signature style and masterful use of gold leaf. once opened, the mirrored zamac lid inside reflects the luminosity, mysterious glamour, and jewel-like quality of each bottle."," bergamot, anise, patchouli, vanilla, cinnamon and honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1013,eau my soul,4160 Tuesdays," while the internet can be a nasty, spiteful, ungenerous place (to say the very least), we're delighted to report that fragrance lovers, by and large, are the exact opposite- which explains the success of many supportive, loving private communities of perfume aficionados online, including christi long's eau my soul. to celebrate this island of positivity, 4160's sarah mccartney offered ems's members a rare chance- vote on their top 25 favorite notes, and she would blend them together into a magnum opus of fragrance. lo and behold, the votes were cast, and sarah delivered with eau my soul, the newest and most democratic of releases from 4160 tuesdays.working primarily from sandalwood and amber, the top two vote-getters, eau my soul is an exuberant delight, or as sarah herself describes it, a ""warm, friendly, inclusive group hug"" of a scent. a fresh bust of early citrus quickly warms into smooth, creamy woods and amber, giving off the delectable vibe of sparkling root beer. as lush florals blend seamlessly with musk, tobacco and honeyed leather, we can't help but think of sinking into a well-worn easy chair in our favorite pajamas, warmed by an unpretentiously casual mixed drink and a bite of our favorite dessert. we know eau my soul is named for the community that launched it. but even if it weren't, the name fits too well to think it could be called anything else."," bergamot, lavender, honey, frankincense, cognac, sandalwood, rose, jasmine, orris, myrrh, tobacco, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, benzoin, musk, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1015,pink wood,April Aromatics," imagine the majestic web of roots beneath the ground's surface - the entwining rhizomatic structure, flowing energy deep from the earth. tanya bochnig, the natural perfumer of april aromatics, has created an ode to these roots with pink wood, a regal blend that taps the root extracts and botanicals from plants growing close to the earth.pink wood unfurls dramatically with rose, the queen of flowers as sappho called her, making her grand entrance in grand doses, in the form of rose absolute and rose otto. the rose feels warm and generous, honeyed around the edges with tart, sweet pink fruits and buttressed by a spiced bourbon-like oakwood. a dignified oud partners with the rose, but it's never overwhelming - in fact, a beautifully aged patchouli and radiant sandalwood smooth out all the edges, as cistus and labdanum expand with earthy darkness. above all else, this is a grounding scent, teaching us that the heart and roots are not so separate after all."," rose otto, rose absolute, geranium, pink fruits, rosewood, sandalwood, agarwood, patchouli, cistus, labdanum, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1016,el cosmico,D.S. and Durga," el cosmico is both a difficult, and an easy, place to explain. on the one hand, it's almost impossible to succinctly describe this campground-turned-venue-turned-hotel-turned-landmark, or the remote, artists'-haven town of marfa where it resides. on the other hand, when you're sitting around a roaring fire under the west texas stars, it's simple to pick a single word: magical. this is at the core of david moltz's el cosmico, an ode to a truly remarkable place where the rustically timeless and the bleeding edge of hip coexist in beautiful harmony. originally conceived for a 2015 performance where a proprietary olfactory instrument circulated scents throughout an outdoor crowd while his band performed, moltz has since synthesized that experience into a single fragrance that perfectly captures the aura of the high plains desert: citric sumac plays against darkly smoky creosote and a zing of mesquite, while robustly fresh pinyon pine and oak lend a woodsy backbone. above it all floats an enchanting, gently sparkling, and almost ozonic note- perhaps the sand accord?- that perfectly evokes the astounding glow of the stars out far beyond any city lights. suspended between the luminous cosmos and the rugged frontier, el cosmico is a delightful, surprising, enchanting new scent from d.s. & durga."," sumac, creosote, pinyon pine, oak, mesquite, sand, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68627.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1055,vitrum,Sammarco," vitrum is a simple but striking fragrance that showcases vetiver, its main star, in all its complex facets. this is a dramatically dark, top-quality vetiver that is gorgeously smoky, and laced with peaty, woody, mossy, earthy, and even salty fresh accents underneath. cool, meditative incense is intertwined within, while touches of black pepper, crisp bergamot, and delicate, soft pink roses dance in the background. the notes shimmer around you, radiating different nuances in a way that lends an air of mystery and excitement to its star note. the result is an airy but strong and multi-faceted take on vetiver that is incredibly refined, smooth, and easy to wear. if you're a fan of the vetiver in chanel's famous sycomore, then vitrum may steal your heart."," vetiver, rose, black pepper, incense, bergamot, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1056,bondt,Sammarco," patchouli and chocolate lovers rejoice, because bond-t will blow your mind with its mouthwatering, dark twist on the gourmand oriental category. inspired by a visit to a top italian chocolatier, sammarco takes the richest black chocolate cake, slathers it in thick layers over a spicy, earthy, and woody patchouli, and then elevates everything to the next level by adding cognac liqueur, sweet plummy fruits, smoky tobacco, smooth leather, and a touch of expresso.  it's a head-turning scent that left us drooling from the first sniff, but the rest of the scent is equally delectable. the luscious darkness eventually turns into a soft golden dream of boozy patchouli enveloped in creamy vanilla and comforting amber. bond-t is a must-try for patchouli lovers as well as fans of serge lutens' borneo, roja dove's enigma, roja dove's amber extrait, and dark chocolate fragrances."," cocoa, patchouli, castoreum, tonka, vanilla, osmanthus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1057,naias,Sammarco," sammarco plays once more with classical and modern perfume styles in this beautifully original, playful fruity floral that caught our attention from the very first sniff with a bright, explosively tart, lip-smacking green apple note. it's lightly sweetened with pear juice and neroli, then poured over jammy red roses, violets, green violet leaf, and a vintage-style accord of lightly powdered iris and lipstick-smelling orris. the vintage elements slowly give way to a very modern darkness, thanks to smoky osmanthus leather that's been coated in amber resins, layered with buttery sandalwood, and licked by a touch of animalic muskiness. as it develops further, naias turns into a chameleon, its soft notes weaving and dancing in the air, frequently changing, sometimes rippling out as a fruity floral leather, sometimes as a creamy irisy woody musk with amber, abstract flowers, tangy fruits, and powder woven in. it eventually finishes as a cashmere soft mix of caramel-scented amber, plush woods, and powdered sweetness. we love naias for its seamless layering of contrasting elements and its effortless mix of genres-- but it's also a lot of fun and easy to wear-- we bet you'll enjoy naias as much as we do!"," violet, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, neroli, iris, sandalwood, apple, pear, cassis, mandarin, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1058,osmanthus,Ormonde Jayne," osmanthus is beautiful 365 days a year. but there's no denying that it really comes into its own in the summer heat, when it wears like the crispest white linen summer dress you've ever had the pleasure of putting on. opening with a lively duo of bitter, greenish citrus and artemisia, the fragrance immediately establishes itself as a very clean, peppery, and invigorating citrusy floral. the osmanthus is there, half-hidden in the rustle of green muguet and leaves, but it is not overly ripe or fruity, instead emitting only delicate wisps of leathery apricot skin. the gently bitter citrus and herbs carry through to the heart, where the osmanthus melts into a radiant white jasmine, creating a gauzy, diaphanous floral effect akin to a flurry of moist petals settling on the surface of green water. and although the base gives us a bit of ambery woods for structure, the overall feel here is of a lively, cheerful floral brimming with pepper and citrus. but don't mistake freshness for banality! as flinty and delicious as a glass of chilled sancerre, osmanthus shows us just how intoxicating crisp, clean flowers can be when handled by the right hands."," pomelo, artemisia, red pepper, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine sambac, cedar, labdanum resin, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1059,taif,Ormonde Jayne," ta'if roses have to hustle to survive in a hostile growing environment, high up on the plains of a rocky region near mecca in saudi arabia. mirroring its harsh environment, the ta'if rose yields oil that is almost as extreme in its biting greenness and peppery spiciness. to complement its obstinate and proud character, linda pilkington chose to surround the rose with an array of exciting arabianflavors, such as saffron and dates - the saffron adding a mysterious, iodine-like touch of leather, the dates adding a juicy sweetness that gives the texture a satisfying, toffee-like chew. ta'if is simply breathtaking. at first sharp and spicy with pepper, the rose note soon emerges in all its pushy, exotic beauty, like a ta'if rose itself erupting through the rocky, arid soil of the mecca plains. later dusted heavily with bitter saffron and softened with a soapy freesia, the rose relaxes into a comfortable, peachy tone that is as unexpected as it is joyful. orange blossom and dates add a fudgy sweetness that nudges the rose towards a persian sweetmeat, giving the fragrance a jellied lokhoum feel. ta'if is never thick or leaden in its exotic sweetness, however, because little wafts of gorse bush-like broom cut through the ambered heft of the base to provide lift and air. a pleasure to wear and smell, ta'if is a gust of authentic desert air, full of spicy rose, orange blossom, and honeyed arabian treats. try it and be transported to another world."," saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1060,tolu,Ormonde Jayne," tolu is that rare animal in perfumery: an oriental that won't have you gasping for air or reaching for an insulin pen. the reason it succeeds  and succeeds so gloriously  is because of its confident balance between the warmly resinous and the briskly herbal. fresh, green clary sage and juniper berry infuse the creamy-sweet amber with gusts of air straight from the deepest pine forest. orange blossom adds a thickly honeyed feel to the resin, but this is balanced immediately by a crisp muguet that illuminates everything with its cool, watery greenness. tart frankincense and roses weave through the creamy, chocolatey tonka bean foundation, aerating it and making it a treat that satisfies completely but will never weigh you down.    it would be remiss of us not to mention tolu's incredible versatility. its plush, velvety depth make it perfectly suited to a night out in paris or the opera; but its sunny warmth also lends itself most affably to snuggling with a loved one, or taking a long walk on cool fall days, kicking over the amber-colored leaves. tolu is the type of fragrance whose delicious-but-not-filling sweetness invites you to bury your nose in your coat collars and scarves to sniff out its lingering trail of gorgeousness."," juniper berry, orange blossom, clary sage, orchid, moroccan rose, muguet (lily of the valley), tolu balsam, tonka bean, golden frankincense, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1061,montabaco,Ormonde Jayne," inspired by the rugged exoticism of the argentinean plains, montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3d picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. all this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with iso e super and hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.a fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air. although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. but the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. the result? a genuinely masculinegaucho type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the argentinean outback. the fragrances in the four corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1062,montabaco  intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," inspired by the rugged exoticism of the argentinean plains, montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3d picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. all this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with iso e super and hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.a fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air. although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. but the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. the result? a genuinely masculinegaucho type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the argentinean outback. the fragrances in the four corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1063,nawab of oudh  intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," nawab of oudh is, essentially, the spirit of a traditional indian attar wrapped up in the format of a western spray fragrance. think a mass of jammy rose petals, fermented magnolia blossoms, and pandan leaf over a warm, spicy amber mercifully free of any vanilla that might weigh it down. the traditional indian attar tends towards the lean and spicy rather than sweet or fatty, and this is a style carried through very faithfully to nawab of oudh.    for those afraid of oud, don't worry  in nawab of oudh, the oud note is there only to gild the other accords with a hint of something animalic, in much the same way as civet was used in classic french perfumery. the main body of this beautiful, majestic fragrance is that warm, salt leather amber wrapped around intensely fragrant rose petals, orange peel, and magnolia, with just a hint of the nobly-rotting wood of oud peeking through the slats every now and then. richly braided and embroidered in the indian tradition, nawab of oudh will make you feel like, well, a nawab."," green notes, bergamot, orange absolute, cardamom, aldehyde, rose, magnolia, orchid, pimento, bay, cinnamon, hedione, ambergris, musk, vetiver, labdanum, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1064,qi  intensivo,Ormonde Jayne," inspired by the chinese symbol qi (pronouncedchi), meaning breath of life', ormonde jayne's qi is a tribute to the aesthetic taste for delicacy that permeates chinese culture from top to toe. never intended to be a showy or dramatic fragrance, qi instead reads as a light breeze carried from a cultivated japanese garden, warmed through with hints of clean, tea-like florals and silky osmanthus petals. qi opens with the balmy bite of neroli and lemon blossom, a delicately fresh precursor to a heart full of osmanthus, which laces the scent with a juicy, apricot-like aroma as well as the lightly tannic scent of green tea leaves. for a while, the scent floats peacefully along in this faintly peppered and fruited tea vein until a soft, mossy musk blurs the edges of the scent. traversing all the minute stops between a fruity osmanthus oolong to a dry, green matã©, qi is simply a must try for tea lovers, or indeed for anyone who values translucence and refinement above all.the fragrances in the four corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats."," green lemon blossom, neroli, freesia, tea notes, osmanthus, violet, hedione, rose, mate, benzoin, musk, moss, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1065,ambre royal,Ormonde Jayne," ambre royal is a resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer is amplified in the base by the hot, salty rasp of ambergris. to wear it is to feel dipped in liquid gold and then rolled in fleurs de sel, the floral salt winnowed from the marshes of brittany. sappy green herbs and juicy orange announce the house signature, their peppery brightness sending a shaft of light through the structure, cheerfully prepping the way for the resins and flowers that follow. behind the sparkle of the opening act, the soft creaminess of flowers beckons - a heart full of rosy, creamy orchid and the delicately leathery apricot of chinese osmanthus. but caressed constantly by sweet, resinous amber and that woody-salty ambergris, the vibe is never overtly floral. the flowers exist mainly to fleck the molten red-gold warmth of the amber with little daubs of watery, dewy freshness, and ensure that the structure retains its luminous weightlessness. in the base, a duo of earthy, chocolatey patchouli and sweet, creamy tonka provide a dark contrast to the shimmering brightness of the top. a sophisticated, and yes, regal amber, it is the salty floral breeze running through ambre royal that positions it far away from the rough and tumble of the souk."," green notes, orange absolute, bergamot, jasmine, orchid, osmanthus, rose, amber, orris, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1066,champaca,Ormonde Jayne," centered on a green tea accord with a squeeze of zesty lemon, champaca is as squeaky clean as a freshly-scrubbed face. it is especially good in hot weather, when the papery coolness of the neroli, bamboo, and green tea steps forward to soothe ruffled tempers and restore internal peace. stirred into this frosty glass of ice tea is a scant teaspoon's worth of basmati rice: subtle but present, it provides just enough cloudy milkiness to take the sting out of the green tea.champaca is unusual in that it's a floral fragrance that doesn't smell too much of flowers, let alone the titular one. there is a hint of peppery freesia, but it comes across more as clean linen than a flower. likewise, there is a lot of waxy, yellow champaca blossom here, but only really perceptible as a burst of something lemony and creamy, like magnolia with an undertow of dusky honey. the flowers simply melt into the basmati rice accord to form a subtly peppery creaminess that relieves the sharp, tannic twang of the green tea and citruses. there is something ineffably charming about champaca  it is rather hard to pin down, but its pearlized, milky freshness gives it all the delicacy of the inside of a conch shell. as sensual as clean skin, we highly recommend champaca as a soft, slightly milky floral oriental that will enchant in even the hottest of weather."," neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1067,frangipani,Ormonde Jayne," frangipani is testament to linda pilkington's exquisite taste, because instead of the cream-sodden tropicalia you might be expecting based on the name, frangipani filters the brightly gaudy flower through a very european sensibility. in other words, no sun umbrellas or leis here. the scent itself opens with a bright squeeze of lime, before quickly sliding into a very true-to-life linden blossom, whose aroma of honey, creamed rice, and green powder forms a logical bridge to the central character of the show - the frangipani. the frangipani note here is so wonderful that it's been allowed to shine unfettered by too many other notes. the flower itself has a gently milky, nutty tiarã©-like scent that later tips over into the full-fat, salted butter of tuberose. but in its first blush, the frangipani displays a rosy peach facet that moistens the heart and gives it a gentle fruitiness. when the frangipani melts into the magnolia, plum, and orchid notes, it forms a blurred, chocolatey floralcy that feels as soft and inviting as the fuzz on a baby's cheek. a resinous, woody base keep the creaminess of the florals in check, ensuring that while frangipani retains its balmy and exotic character, it never crosses the line into loudness. a beautiful scent for those who want to dip a tentative toe into tropical waters."," linden blossom, magnolia, lime, frangipani, rose, tuberose, water lily, plum, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1068,isfarkand,Ormonde Jayne," isfarkand is a mysterious thing. its structure is simple and relatively linear  peppery citruses over grassy vetiver and radiant woods  but it transmits such a laid-back, uncluttered appeal that you'll find yourself wondering if there's more to it than meets the eye. ormonde jayne's signature opening notes of pink pepper and citrus burn even brighter than normal here, giving the scent the exciting zestiness of a freshly-peeled lime. the peppery spice hugs the toasty cedar and vetiver tightly, the result being a close-knit mã©lange of clean woods, citrus, grass, and spice that is so pleasurable to wear that it doesn't really make sense to try and pick it apart.isfarkand is as easy to wear as a favorite shirt, so don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for it, again and again, even over fragrances that you think you like better. it sounds simple - and it is - but somehow a certain ormonde jayne magic ties it all together, making it one of the classiest and most versatile everyday options for the modern man. as a subtle, my-skin-but-better woody vetiver for all seasons, isfarkand is hard to beat."," lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1069,ormonde man,Ormonde Jayne," ormonde jayne man takes the bracing coniferous freshness of ormonde jayne woman, and spins it in a slightly different direction, peppering the topnotes with a sparkling lemon and juniper pairing, and giving the basic structure a drier, cleaner feel, with plenty of cedar and agarwood in the drydown for muscle. juniper, coriander, and a clever use of cardamom up front give the opening a turbo-blast of luridly green, almost fruity spice that propels the scent forwards, as if tied to a jetpack. although different in feel and texture to ormonde jayne woman, ormonde man retains all of its sister scent's mysterious, witchy atmosphere. imagine losing your way in a thick pine forest in winter; it is dark and cold, but oddly, you feel at complete peace. all around you, the trees exhale their sweet essence of conifer and pine sap, and you breathe it in gladly, knowing that it is both cleansing and nourishing. the oud wood is dry and medicinal, but merged with the sandalwood, cedar, spice, and musk, it becomes less spice route and more traditional chinese health potion. the drydown is a sheer wash of pinewood and pepper, a watercolor print of the powerful first half that nonetheless works as the perfect fragrance for a gentleman who favors class over volume."," juniper berry, bergamot, pink pepper, cardamom, coriander, agarwood, black hemlock, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1070,ormonde woman,Ormonde Jayne," ormonde jayne woman is one of those fragrances that are almost impossible to describe using the listed notes, because it only makes sense when explained as an atmosphere or a feeling. for example, we might be able to tell you that this scent contains cardamom, coriander, and the witchy-sounding black hemlock, but we're at a loss as to explain how or why the sum of this simple list of materials is a whole forest from the brothers grimm, complete with hansel and gretel, and baba yaga waiting in her smoky gingerbread house. and yet, it truly is.first, a forest's worth of pungent green herbs and grasses is unfurled beneath your feet, the dark shadows of poison ivy and european oaks swallowing up all the natural daylight at the edges. this velveteen, viridian carpet is dotted with moist, sweet little violets and jasmine petals, their frilly innocence incongruous against the sinister background of forest woods. ormonde jayne woman is a deeply coniferous scent with a fair amount of bitterness, but what really tugs at the heartstrings is its errant thread of sweetness - that smoky, spicy amber note that weaves through the perfume like a siren call to tempt children and adults alike. one of the rare perfumes that truly deserves its reputation asmysterious, we defy you to wear this and not be shaken and stirred."," cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1133,absolue dosmanthe,Perris Monte Carlo," if osmanthus is having a moment in modern perfumery, it's a well-deserved one: elegantly fruity, sensual and softly creamy, it's long past time that this beautiful floral stepped out of the supporting shadows and into the limelight. and it would be hard to think of a more impressive debutante than absolue d'osmanthe, an utterly stunning new floral scent fresh off of taking esxence 2017 by storm and now ready to go worldwide. fresh and fruity, but also richly mouthwatering and romantic, this is everything we always suspected a perfect osmanthus scent could be. absolue d'osmanthe wastes no time putting its gorgeous title ingredient front and center, opening bright and fruity with the apricot-like tones the flower is known for. as with all great soliflore scents, the supporting notes are meant less to twist the fragrance in any particular direction and more to coax out each facet of the featured player, and absolue completely delivers: plum to add juicy depth to the fruity notes and rose and jasmine to accentuate the luscious softness. as it dries, subtly rich balsamic, woodsy and creamy notes (with just the right hint of animalic castoreum) emerge to resonate with the smooth, leather-toned sexiness hidden within osmanthus's soft lactonic depths. is absolue d'osmanthe the perfect osmanthus scent? at the very least, we're confident when we say this impossibly gorgeous fragrance is going to be quite hard for future challengers to top."," osmanthus, plum, baie rose, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, tolu balsam, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla, dry woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70208.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1134,santal du pacifique,Perris Monte Carlo," there's a reason why sandalwood is among the most important and widely used materials in fragrance, with a versatility that allows perfumers to explore everything from creamy richness to sophisticated coolness. featuring an extraordinary sandalwood from the south pacific, where the species was discovered, santal du pacifique demonstrates the full range of this majestic material, woodsy, naturalistic, but also velvety and smooth, all in the service of a fragrance that manages to perfectly balance elegance with simplicity.every supplemental ingredient in santal du pacifique seems expertly chosen to enhance the titular material, from the earthy balance of the carrot and earthy floral opening, to the rich balsam and smooth musk of the later stages. each reveals an extra facet of sandalwood, sometimes sexy and fashion-forward, often rich and comforting, always with a dignity that belies its luxury. for those who find that  subtle, natural sandalwood fragrances don't pack enough punch, but that edgy, complicated sandalwoods have wallpapered over their star ingredient's natural brilliance, we say that santal du pacifique is the most exquisite compromise you could ever dream of."," carrot, orchid, violet, gurjum balsam, pacific sandalwood, dry woods, cashmere woods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70209.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1135,vanille blackberry,Comptoir Sud Pacifique," a heavenly exercise by comptoir sud pacifique, exploring the possibilities for a fragrance both fresh and velvety-soft. vanille blackberry sings brightly from the start, opening playfully tart with a burst of fizzing lemon and bergamot. then, the lovely cloud of floral fruit takes over, with rose and jasmine in attendance, but never too heady, just light and pretty. but in the billowing cloud, the stars of the show are blackberry and vanilla, forming a sweet, velvety-soft melange. the blackberry creates a perfect, lightly piquant contrast to the swoon-worthy classic comptoir sud pacifique vanilla. like a tea-time delicacy, this soft, floral-fruity vanilla just gets smoother in the drydown, light and delicate, enveloped in white musk and cashmere woods. luscious, fluffy, yet glowing - a must for any vanilla lover."," lemon, bergamot, rose, jasmine, blackberry, pink berries, musk, vanilla, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/23814.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1136,une tonne de roses,Parle Moi de Parfum," so called because it takes 3.5 tons of rose petals to make just one kilo of rose essence, une tonne de roses has a natural delicacy that belies its hefty name. it opens with a fresh, soft pink rose glistening with the wet sparkle of fruit  green apple or an asian pear, perhaps. there is also, briefly, a hint of something winey and truffled playing around the edges of the rose, but it never commits to darkness. this is an innocent little rosebud of a rose, just about to burst into being.we start out in spring, with a dewy rose, but we end up in fall, with a clean, earthy patchouli. although more a watercolor than the gouache of almairac's earlier masterpiece, voleur de roses, une tonne de roses completes a similar journey, fading from the pale pink blush of the rose to the golden brown leaf mulch of patchouli. finishing in a clean, crystalline musk, une tonne de roses strikes us as a japanese screen version of the ever-popular rose and patchouli combination  delicate, crisp, and achingly pretty."," rose, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1137,flavia vanilla,Parle Moi de Parfum," inspired by the lyrical, shiny-eyed beauty of an italian girl called flavia that michel almairac once knew, flavia vanilla is a dark, minimally smoky floral vanilla with hints of a tropical, humid ylang ylang playing at its edges. the spiced banana flambã© of ylang of the opening notes is as attention-getting as a confident lady who dances her way through a crowded piazzo. but there is also a fresh, youthful breeze running through the perfume  a touch of green magnolia-like notes from the michelia flower that serve to keep the flamboyant sensuality of the custardy ylang firmly in check. flavia vanilla is a scent that reminds us that simplicity is the key to true beauty, and that sometimes all that's need is fresh vanilla, flowers, and a trace of smoke to fill the heart with pleasure."," ylang ylang, michelia, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1138,totally white,Parle Moi de Parfum," totally white captures the ethereal, foggy dew of a spring morning in a parisian city park. it smells like a field of wildflowers waking up en masse. the delicate, slightly honeyed scent of lilac and wisteria mingle with the intoxicatingly bitter, leathery scent of the hawthorn bushes, creating an effect so pollen-rich and watery-cool that you'd forgive early morning joggers for looking dazed and slightly drunk. this is a fragrance whose subtlety might make you forget you're wearing it but for the perceptible effect it has on people around you. the pale, soft-focus blurriness of the florals merges so completely with the pheromones of your own skin that people hugging you will pull you a little tighter, entranced by what they think is your natural smell. it is an intimate, soft scent, the foggy musk and pale spring flowers all working together to form a muted color palette against which your own personality sparkles like a diamond. beautiful work."," lilac, wisteria, hawthorn",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1139,cedar woodpecker,Parle Moi de Parfum," the amusingly-named cedar woodpecker is a spicy, citrusy cedar fragrance with impeccable taste and noble lineage. at once robust and refined, the rich virginian cedarwood forms the glowing brown heart of the fragrance, displaying a stoutness of character you just know you can rely on. on top, a turbo-charged cedrat fizzes and snaps like a cable wire loose in a storm  this note is exciting and has movement, charging the sturdy cedar underneath with electricity. the contrast between the sourness of that green citrus and the warmth of the cedar is both exhilarating and comfortable. it just works. a dove-grey iris in the base is a fluffy pillow on which the cedar finally rests his grizzled, noble old head. the faint hint of powdery florals doesn't detract from the muscular, essentially woody, masculine character of the scent, but rather add a velvety softness that soothes and calms. the iris also introduces the faint echo of guerlainade: lovers of the classic habit rouge might want to check out its more modern, stripped-down, and rugged younger brother. in an age when men are short-changed on good masculines, cedar woodpecker comes as a welcome surprise."," cedar, citrus, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1140,milky musk,Parle Moi de Parfum," in the late 1990's and under the direction of tom ford, michel almairac created one of the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century: gucci rush. a massive lactonic peach with a voice like a foghorn, it wore like the tightest, shiniest red vinyl dress ever created. now twenty years later, michel picks up the reins again to create a softer, muskier version that explores the same theme of milk and fruit, but this time with an indoors voice. milky musk first melts a leafy-green, coconutty fig down into a pool of warm, creamy sandalwood and wraps it all in a cloudy, milky musk that feels like cashmere. soft and vaporous, it shifts around the body like a second skin as the wearer moves. over time, the musk parts to reveal the bitterness of fruit skin, giving the creamy lactones an adult bite. imagine a slimmed-down rush, grown soft and husky with age, and you're in the right ballpark. it's adorable."," sandalwood, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1141,tomboy neroli,Parle Moi de Parfum," tomboy neroli is a paradox: sexy and clean. it smells like a freshly-laundered cotton t-shirt stripped off a hot, young body that has been wearing a classic eau de cologne all day. male or female? doesn't matter. when it's this good, it's for everyone.  the crisp greenness of neroli up top is as refreshing as drenching oneself in eau de cologne straight from the fridge on a hot day. as it melts into the waxy orange blossom notes underneath, the neroli loses its freshness and becomes subsumed by the honeyed warmth of the white floral. all of this draped over a smoky woody amber that gives you the chemical high of a good white musk. the equivalent of the perfect white t-shirt, this one's for sexy tomboys everywhere."," neroli, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1142,woody perfecto,Parle Moi de Parfum," woody perfecto is a seemingly simple mix of coffee, vetiver, and leather, but there is something so nailed about this fragrance that it's hard to keep a grin off our face. coffee is a difficult note to pull off; in woody perfecto, you get a perfectly dark, roasted bean with no off notes or milkiness to distract from the main event. just damn fine coffee, as agent cooper would say.   with a smoky vetiver and a touch of black, worn leather, we have no difficulty grasping the vision of the scent's creators here when they talk about living in the shoes of a rock star. wearing this, we are suddenly drinking black coffee, watching the roadies rigging the sound equipment, breathing in the smell of warm, trampled grass, cigarette smoke, and the warm bodies of excited fans pressing close. dark and straightforwardly masculine, this is what you wear when anticipation is a shape in the air."," coffee, vetiver, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1143,satori,Parfum Satori," for her house's signature scent,  satori osawa needed the perfect fusion of french and japanese materials,  techniques,  and aesthetics,  and yet her inspiration came from a precious ingredient derived from somewhere else entirely- middle eastern agarwood,  or oud. and yet,  the choice is perfect,  as agarwood exemplifies the japanese concept of ""five tastes, "" exhibiting spicy,  bitter,  sweet,  sour and salty facets all at once. a fragrance that fully encapsulates all five of these elements,  satori features a carefully selected suite of notes meant to complement each,  with cinnamon and clove enhancing the spicy,  cacao the bitter,  vanilla the sweet,  and bitter orange,  oak moss and cypress for the sour and salty. blended over a smooth,  woody bed of sandalwood and frankincense,  eastern and western elements converge with sublime balance,  creating a gentle,  warm and enveloping atmosphere. in this way,  satori is ultimately a fragrance that is universal but delightfully specific,  where japanese concepts become a global philosophy- elegant,  romantic and enchanting."," bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1144,iris homme,Parfum Satori," the traditional arts of japan are permeated with a dedication to simplicity- the idea that the more diligently and deliberately a flower is placed, or a brushstroke applied, the more significant it becomes. as a guiding principle for perfumery, it represents a departure from the operatic construction of european classics, and it is this principle that makes iris homme a deeply distinguished masculine of powerful subtlety. iris homme opens with bright, clarifying citrus, an authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast with an undercurrent of spicy cardamom that leads into the dry floral heart. the iris in question recalls mpg's classic iris bleu gris in its clean, robust take on the note, but here the naturalism is slightly more incorporated, as an earthy violet and jasmine combination lingers softly but noticeably in the background. a warmly accessible base of ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple and long-lasting character, making this an ideal fragrance for situations formal and informal alike. simplicity, after all, leaves ample room for interpretation."," lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1145,hana hiraku,Parfum Satori," the oriental category of perfumes has long been embellished by western perfumers,  constructing olfactory fantasies as seen from the outside. with hana hiraku,  satori osawa deconstructs the oriental,  departing from what she calls the westernizedglossy note and,  as a japanese perfumer,  creates a new category that she calls adry oriental, "" defined by a more matte quality. in hana hiraku (ora flower blooms),  earthy,  savory notes of miso and mitarashi,  or sweet soy sauce,  replace the animalic notes present in more middle eastern-style oriental perfumes. the sensual,  intoxicating quality of oriental perfumery transforms into coolly understated je-ne-sais-quoi,  like a romantic at arm's length.  hana hiraku blooms first with a sweet,  creamy musk melon,  freshly cut with a salted knife. the honeydew is soft but prominent,  and lifts up pale,  watery magnolia flowers in all their green and aquatic glory. quite distinctive is the addition of japanese miso,  which lends its uniquely briny,  earthy umami quality to ground the floating magnolia. this union is actually not unusual in japanese cuisine,  where the large leaves of the magnolia tree are used as plates or for wrapping and baking miso or mochi rice cakes. this harmonious relationship reaches new heights with the sustained soft-focus cream of the melon,  and achieves a sublime sensuality for the senses. this is no dripping or heavy scent,  but rather it is perfume as seen through a frosted glass  diffuse,  tender,  and delicately blurred."," melon, bergamot, galbanum, magnolia, iris, jasmine, tuberose, rose, ylang ylang, chamomile, miso, kogashi-shoyu, beeswax, sandalwood, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1146,wasanbon,Parfum Satori," wasanbon is an intricate puzzle veiled in beguiling charm. evoking japanese tea-time, wasanbon is a type of fine japanese sugar hand-purified in multiple stages, used to make the highest class of delicate sugar candy. perfumer satori osawa was tickled by its homonym in french,wa sent bon meaningwa smells good  wa being the japanese word for social harmony. unlike the typical scent imagined from the concept of wa, wasanbon is mischievous, gliding into any situation with its sparkling confectionary charm, but slowly revealing the elegant, refined heart within. a tart, tangy lemon opens the fragrance, immediately uplifting, giddy on clouds. not only is it sprinkled with crystalline sugar, but rounded out with juicy muscat grape, tart and sweet. these immediate fruits give way to a most delicate, pillowy mã©lange of lightly honeyed mimosa flower, lily-of-the-valley, and the body of the fragrance, an exquisite wasanbon sugar, finely purified and crushed, sieved into the finest powder. a dusting of almond and vanilla only add to the heavenly delight of the senses. as the candy dissolves away, wasanbon remains light and airy, lifted with an exquisite iris and soft, velvety guaiacwood. what could be more charming?"," lemon, muscat, mimosa, muguet, almond, sugar, honey, vanilla, iris, guaiacwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1147,io non ho mani che mi accarezzino il volto,UNUM," io non ho mani che mi accarezzino il volto - ""there are no hands / to caress my face."" this is the beginning of a 1948 poem by father david maria turoldo, which the italian photographer mario giacomelli took as the name for a photography series in the early 1960s. it's these photos that serve as the inspiration for unum's founder and artist filippo sorcinelli's new fragrance. the photos are striking: disarming images of young priests in states of joyous movement, dancing and playing. the fragrance is an olfactory rendering of the stunning imagery, capturing the humanity beneath the black cassocks.  the fragrance opens with a fizzy glow of crackling petitgrain and bergamot, which lifts up to reveal the heart: a breathtaking wall of scent, flawlessly blended cedar with spice, like cinnamon, and clary sage, ylang ylang, and resins. the drydown evokes what we imagine the seminary could have been, its stone walled building resonating with sandalwood, rituals cloaked in incense and benzoin, and the warm puff of tobacco. it transports you into giacomelli's photographs of the clergymen smoking cigars - when the rector saw these images, it was the last straw, and giacomelli was prevented from ever photographing at the seminary again."," petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1148,black phantom,By Kilian," through a glass, darkly. black phantom is a unisex woody gourmand that will please just about everyone. its topnotes have a dangerous glitter to them, like a glass of rum rimmed in cane sugar set alight, sending sparks of roasted nuts, caramel, booze, and smoke out into the night air. once the boozy fireflies have dimmed a little, a gentler accord begins to bloom  a wonderfully soft, nutty sandalwood that reminds us of caramelized pain de mie dipped into warm milk. but despite all the foodie notes, black phantom is not thick or heavy. shot through with wisps of woodsmoke, resin, and roasted coffee, black phantom is clearly a gourmand aimed at more adult tastes. imagine a cozy parisian cafã© on a cold, rainy day. you are reading a book and sipping a milky coffee with a drop of rum on the side to warm your bones. delicious aromas of pralines, fresh pastries, chocolate, toasted nuts, and coffee melt waft over the papery vanilla smell of your book and the bitter almond posies of heliotrope on each table. now imagine the undertow of a really good sandalwood that smells like salty butter and sweet cream. it really doesn't get better than this if you love grown-up, unisex gourmands."," rum, sugar cane, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, almond, heliotrope, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1150,bracken woman,Amouage," inspired by 1960s counterculture, bracken is an elegantly wild concoction for the modern hippie. a smoky, herbal potion with sweet woodland flowers and wild berries, bracken woman opens with a delicious clash of ferny green notes and tangy red fruit juices. then, a rush of herbal and floral aromas tumble together for a love-in with smoky, birchy leather. in the middle stage, the loamy aroma of damp earth is joined by patchouli, and the florals intensify, giving an impression of moist tobacco and crushed blossoms.bracken woman eventually relaxes into a woody green floral. but it stays very much a creature of the forest: earthy, verdant and more than a bit mysterious. for those craving the natural romance of the summer of love but aren't willing to compromise on sophistication, bracken woman is here to deliver flower power--with style."," bracken accord, wild berries, lily, narcissus, chamomile, smoky leather accord, patchouli, vetiver, birch",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41884.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1153,tel aviv,Gallivant," a true mixture of mediterranean elegance, modern middle east heat, and cosmopolitan cool, tel aviv is like nowhere else on earth. it's bright white sun, gold jewelry on tanned skin, a lingering 1970's glamour. it's sexy, it's a party, it's life in the bubble. it's walking along the beach, naked skin, feeling relaxed, with the big city bustling right next door, full of noise, people and mad intensity. it's stopping at the juice stall on dizengoff, smelling the fresh clementines and sweet stone fruits. it's the heat, the sweat, the cigarette smoke, and the sweet florals from the overhead balconies, all sewn together with the warm musk of human flesh and youthful energy."," clementine, bergamot, blackcurrant bud, jasmine sambac, ylang ylang, rose oil, freesia, sandalwood, musks, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1154,la tosca,Xerjoff - Casamorati," shockingly violent, sweeping and modern when it premiered, puccini's tosca was a true spectacle, drawing heated and mixed critical reaction- and the absolute adoration of the public, who flocked to its every sold-out performance. having already been transformed into an italian-language opera from a french-language play, tosca's further transformation into a perfume with cross-border influence seems all too appropriate, and so it may come as no surprise that it's a crowd-pleasing success- a colorful, broadly painted grand-dame floral mixing freshness and lusciousness, bright herbal tones and smooth vanilla creaminess, for a truly romantic work of art. many fragrances claim to be operatic, but tosca, with its crisp and green citrus opening, herbaceous floral heart, and rich drydown, really does feel like a scent in three distinct, yet connected, acts, guiding us on an ever-moving emotional journey that twists, turns, and ultimately uplifts the spirit."," italian lemon, green manadarin, bulgarian rose, eucalyptus, violet leaves, patchouli, musk, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1155,mirabilis,L'Artisan Parfumeur," elegant in its simplicity, mirabilis is the natura fabularis collection's and perfumer daphne bugey's attempt to tackle one of man's deepest questions- nature vs science- with a clever, fragrant twist. here, the debate between the rational and the spiritual plays out in bugey's choice of ingredients, with the natural world represented first via a rich, gently earthy incense, the most fundamental of all perfume ingredients, recalling ancient devotionals and primal understandings. then, the scientific comes into focus, combining the comforting cleanness of ambrox with vulcanolide, a cutting edge synthetic musk with earthy and amber facets. the result is a fragrance that wears lightly, but not weakly- there's an elemental power beneath the surface, humming with clean energy, but also just enough earthiness to never fully leave the natural realm. part rational, part spiritual, mirabilis is a true reconciliation between reason and belief.each natura fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," ambrox, incense, white musk vulcanolide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1156,arcana rosa,L'Artisan Parfumeur," there's no shortage of pithy phrases involving roses and thorns, but you'd never know it by smelling the bland softness of most mass market rose fragrances. luckily, arcana rosa's thorns are front and center, hardened over an open cedar fire and spiked with rooty vetiver and prickly cade. through the smoke, a lush, beautifully full bodied bulgarian rose still asserts its beauty, but the woods and resins transmute its strength into something of awe and danger, a rose equally at home on a man or woman. we're not surprised that the natura fabularis collection needed a rose. we're simply grateful that they decided that they decided that the same old rose just wouldn't do.each natura fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," rose, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, cade, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1157,tenebrae,L'Artisan Parfumeur," tenebrae, as the official text from the natura fabularis collection describes it, is the scent of a ""dark and shadowy forest"" so overgrown that light barely peeks through the treetops, and we certainly wouldn't disagree. but in true fairy tale fashion, this forest hides not only mysterious dangers, represented with dark resins and woods, but also mystical wonders, in the form of a marvelously sweet and complex crystallized sap note that combines with a not-too-heavy dose of incense. the result is a fragrance that lifts us upwards, letting us know that the sun is still there, even if we can't quite see it.each natura fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," incense, resin, sap",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1158,violaceum,L'Artisan Parfumeur," it takes all of a second for the beauty of a flower to topple over in the darkness. composed for l'artisan parfumeur's exclusive collection, natura fabularis, violaceum pays tribute to the ephemeral character of nature. in the shade of a forest lies a carpet of violets. despite their delicate nature, these flowers are not prone to sentimentality. the usually powdery sensation is replaced by an impression of leather. the perfumer, daphnã© bugey, creates confusion and depth by combining the violet, cousin of the iris, to an accord of carrot and saffron. a simple flower can no longer be perceived, and instead, a complex and poetic blend comes together, where gastronomy and the floral arts meet in two distinct new accords: carrot-saffron and leathery-violet. as violaceum deepens on the skin, it resonates with poetic clarity- classic and contemporary all at once.each natura fabularis fragrance is presented in an exquisite glass atomizer flacon with a beautiful metal bee detail."," carrot, saffron, leather, violet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1161,feu secret,Bruno Fazzolari," of the four grades of fire with which the ancient alchemists worked,  the primary one for the true alchemist was the secret fire  the fire that was able to affect matter without having a physical presence itself.  it is theserpentine working power in the body,  the electro-spiritual,  creative life force of the alchemist himself.  the acclaimed artist-perfumer bruno fazzolari has brought the secret fire to life in this shape-shifting ode to the orris root. feu secret opens with a bright-cold burst of pink pepper and eucalyptus that lifts the orris root to the sun,  almost mimicking a citrus note. this is no earthy-cold iris  if anything,  the spices bring out the hidden warmth of the orris butter,  melting into the skin. the transformative nature of the iris comes out in the heart,  not lipstick-violet in any mortal way,  but ethereally smoky,  reaching its roots into the earth. reducing all other attempts at rooty orris to mere sweet carrots,  rising tendrils of birch tar smoke give way to a gauzy,  woody veil,  enthroned in vanilla and cedar. the vibrant life energy is properly interpreted here,  by turns airy,  fiery,  and earthy on the skin.  as a divine incantation,  feu secret is surprisingly androgynous and sublimely distinctive."," hemlock spruce, eucalyptus, iris, turmeric, pink pepper, himalayan cedar, birch tar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69308.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1164,cypress shade,The House Of Oud," more shade than cypress, cypress shade is so astonishingly good at capturing the cool, herbal dampness of the ground under a cypress tree that you might want to curl up and take a little nap. take a good book with you, and a glass of ice-cold pastis.the mastic woodiness of the cypress does not dominate, forming instead a softly green, balsamic curtain through which the other notes shine. fresh mint, vetiver, and coriander form a cooling mat of aromatic grasses that is as welcome on a hot day as a cool cloth on the forehead. the unmistakable licorice snap of anise darts and weaves through the damp green notes, turning the mind most pleasurably to the midday aperitif. but what elevates this scent beyond the standard woody aromatic is the mimosa, a powdery yellow flower that smells like almond flour, glue, cucumber, and innocence itself. the mimosa sparkles before folding itself into a vigorous base of madagascaran cedar and haitian vetiver. it ends, as all things should, in the milky, anise-tinted blur of pastis."," lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1374,messy sexy just rolled out of bed,A Lab on Fire," everyone loves the smell of vanilla, and yet somehow the perfect, universally wearable vanilla seems elusively rare- mouthwatering bakery gourmands scare away lovers of wispier, more floral concoctions, and both varieties are often seen as too feminine for men to wear. this is why we're so enthused with dominique ropion's brilliant creation for a lab on fire-- a just-right vanilla musk that we think smells divine on just about anyone. this enchanting elixir is sweet without seeming gooey, compelling without shouting in your face, and romantic with enough restraint to wear well on men and women alike. a soft rose lends its velvety tones throughout, darting in and out among the star players of clean musk, rich tonka bean absolute, vanilla, and amber. the ever-so-slightly powdery almond notes of heliotrope are the perfect complement, softening and rounding out the sweet toffee and barely-there blonde woods. messy sexy just rolled out of bed is a season-spanning wonder, displaying a warming sweet coziness on cool fall days, while bergamot and peach blossom bring a fresh, light addition to summer sunshine. with versatility like that, it's no wonder that messy sexy just rolled out of bed is one of the best crowd-pleasing vanillas we've ever put our noses on.formerly known as mon musc a moi. messy sexy just rolled out of bed is the same perfume, now with a new name."," bergamot, peach blossom, rose, heliotrope, musk, toffee, amber, white woods, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1381,noir exquis,L'Artisan Parfumeur," the parisian patisserie is so much more than a simple shop- it's a place of wonder, where exquisite pastry and invigorating coffee aromas set the backdrop for timeless friendships, fierce intellectual debates, lazy afternoons, and chance romantic encounters. it was the last of these things, the idea of love blossoming over eclairs and cafã© au lait, that inspired bertrand duchaufour to create noir exquis, a wondrous new gourmand that combines the mouthwatering scents of a patisserie with a deep, sophisticated, and luminous base of woods and floral amber that sings of attraction, connection and delight. noir exquis opens with a succulent combination of sweet orange and deep, rich chestnut, which soon opens up to a heart of syrupy maple and a true, full-bodied coffee that balances as perfectly against the sweets as the real thing. as it dries down, a delightful, lightly almond-inflected heliotrope blends perfectly with a creamy vanilla, while a notably darker wood note, described here as ebony, lends a dynamic and romantic touch to smoother, lightly powdery notes of tonka and sandalwood. what duchaufour has created here is not a mere representation of a patisserie, but rather a capsule of every positive feeling one could associate with such a place. the results are truly lovely, and we're happy to say that noir exquis is a creamy, sweet, beautiful new achievement for one of our favorite perfumers."," chestnut, orange, orange blossom, coffee, maple syrup, ebony, heliotrope, vanilla, tonka, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1382,phi une rose de kandahar,Tauer Perfumes," phi is a luxurious scent, inspired by a natural extract of roses produced in afghanistan's rose region, nangarhar. this rose oil is extremely rare and of highest quality. inspired by these roses, growing in a dry and rough land, phi is a rare gem, complementing contrasting lines, rich in natural raw materials that add depth and authenticity. due to the limited amount of the rose oil, une rose de kandahar is not guaranteed to be available all the time.the scent starts with a rich fruity line of apricot. an all natural apricot extract with its surprising richness enchants and blends into a stretch of cinnamon and  hints of bitter almond, softened by bergamot essential oil. these spices lead over to voluptuous roses in the fragrance heart: extremely rare rose essential oil with its unique scent of spices, plums and flower petals blends into rose absolute from bulgaria and hints of bourbon geranium. the rose petals melt on the skin into a dark tobacco fond, built around an amazing absolute of dried tobacco leaves. the animalic, leathery and woody tobacco opens the ground for a generously dosed layer of patchouli in the base of phi. here, woody and gourmand notes melt into hints of animalic lines. vetiver, vanilla and tonka add richness and brilliance. a generous dose of exclusive musk and ambergris round the body of the fragrance and encircle the roses."," apricot, cinnamon, almond, bergamot, bulgarian rose absolute, rose from kandahar, bourbon geranium, tobacco leaf, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, musk and ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31431.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1383,sotto la luna tuberose,Tauer Perfumes," the genius of andy tauer has always been his ability to see past- or perhaps to not see at all- the conventional, in service of his own unique perception of the scents and notes he loves. so while for most, a ""natural smelling"" tuberose would default into cool, creamy rich white floral territory, andy's sotto la luna tuberose turns in the other direction, envisioning a beguilingly green, peppery floral that brings the ""queen of the night"" into bright, warm daylight.    long time tauer lovers will have particular reason to rejoice, as from the very first clove-spiced, galbanum-rich spray, it's clear that sotto la luna tuberose is a throwback to tauer's most iconic and distinct fragrances. weaving through the rich spicy warmth of this full dose of ""tauerade"", the heavy dose of natural tuberose absolute asserts herself-- creamy and floral as you'd expect, but so expertly blended against sweet ylang and stemmy jasmine as to bathe the notes in vibrant warmth and fresh green tones that feel spicy, natural and utterly unique. as the soft woods, patchouli and briskly musky ambergris base emerges, the tuberose is both softened and elevated, wonderfully recognizable while still leagues apart from any tuberose we've smelled before. is sotto la luna tuberose a typically unadorned soliflore? perhaps not traditionally. but in a very real sense, that's exactly what it is: a singular, artistic vision of tuberose, as only andy tauer could bring us."," cinnamon, cloves, galbanum, geranium, tuberose, ylang ylang, rose, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31432.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1384,jasmin angelique cologne absolue,Atelier Cologne," when most fragrance houses announce a jasmine scent, it doesn't necessarily move the needle, but as a house dedicated solely to cologne-style compositions, the notably indolic, sensual white flower might seem a bit more challenging. luckily for us, jerome epinette and atelier cologne have done it again- jasmin angã©lique is a stunning, crisply complex cologne absolue that balances layers of herbaceous green notes against a lovely, lilting jasmine accord that feels natural, fresh and warmly comforting. jasmin angã©lique opens with a crisp, spicy burst of sicilian lemon, set against a fiery, energetic kick of sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced by a floral yet fresh jasmine, resinous galbanum, and a lovely green fig note, which together give the impression of breathing deeply while walking through a meadow on a warm spring afternoon. this wondrous sensation lingers for hours, until slowly warming into the smooth, warm and light amber drydown. vivid, green and aromatic, jasmin angã©lique is wholly unlike any jasmine fragrance we've tried before- and that's precisely what we love about it."," lemon, sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1385,iris cendre,Naomi Goodsir," enigmatic, elegant and enchanting, the iris is one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients- and also one of its most challenging. so when we heard that naomi goodsir's first-ever floral was to be named iris cendrã© (or ""iris ash""), our hearts began to flutter with anticipation of an iris fragrance that might transcend convention and offer a bold new portrait of this beloved material. and even beyond our wildest dreams, goodsir and perfumer julien rasquinet have delivered a bona fide masterpiece- a lush, warm, buttery interpretation of iris with a gorgeously restrained hint of smokiness that feels both wonderfully creative, and quintessentially naomi goodsir.before even the first spray, iris cendrã© affirms its rarity with a striking green color that results from its uniquely high concentration of true iris concrete, a property that gives the fragrance its striking depth and nuance. while the opening presents a crisp, delicately fruity burst of bergamot and spiced tangerine, the rich heart of buttery iris soon takes over, displaying a gorgeously evocative facet of the flower with warmer, more sultry tones than we've ever before found in an iris scent. a light veil of violet reinforces the floral depth, while a sensually smoky accord of cistus, tobacco and amber evokes the distinctly complex drydown of another naomi goodsir classic, bois d'ascese. the overall effect is both subtle and striking, a wholly unisex floral that seems to contain multitudes without ever raising its voice, feeling vivid and deep but also masterfully restrained. with iris cendrã©, naomi goodsir and julien rasquinet have redefined what we thought an iris scent could be and in doing so, created a new reference."," bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1387,incense flash,Tauerville," for the third entry in his joyfully creative tauerville project, andy tauer turns his attention to an ingredient that his primary line has ample familiarity with: incense. and while incense flash's woods-and-incense motif seems to cover some familiar ground, we're pleased to report that this earthy, leathery, compulsively sniffable scent walks a deft line between comfortable and creative, with ample appeal for lovers of andy's previous incense work and newcomers alike. as would befit a fragrance named incense flash, the incense buzzes from the very first spray, dry enough to bring out the natural earthiness of the boswellia serrata incense used, but supplemented with a subtly musky, woodsy sharpness- dare we say a hint of the famous tauer signature? as incense flash dries, the incense lingers, now paired against a wonderfully evocative leather- rough and dusty, yet as it dries increasingly supple and smooth. what now lasts for hours is a new reference for incense scents, less forest, painter's studio or bazaar and more starlit, high desert vista. distinct, compelling and easy to wear, incense flash is at once uniquely an andy tauer creation- and also something altogether new."," leather, musky woods, ambergris, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1388,framboise noire,Shay & Blue," like an aged wine in an ancient cellar, framboise noire is a testament to the darker side of berries and wood, a celebration of the complexity that can be achieved in pitch blackness. opening with a note of rare black raspberries mixed with a handful of juicy red forest berries, framboise noir begins both sweet and nuanced, before a heart note of seductive iris adds floral depth and a modern touch. a base of rich white oud and dark, musky black woods increases the sensuality, igniting the palate and deepening the sophistication. sweet, rich and more than a bit dangerous, framboise noire is an enticing invitation to discover what lurks in the darkness."," black raspberry, mixed berries, iris pallida, white oud, black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1391,venetian bergamot,TOM FORD Private Blend," bergamot- fresh, fruity, spicy and complex- is perhaps the most unsung hero of perfumery of all styles and histories. without bergamot, eaux de cologne lose their snappy freshness, fougeres forego their bracing sharpness, and chypres fall into flat, heavy dullness. it's therefore only appropriate that tom ford's new venetian bergamot, a modern-facing blend of these renowned styles of fragrance, keeps the noble bergamot front and center, sweeping us off our feet with the versatility and vibrancy of italian bergamot carefully supported in a lush, fresh, spicy blend of woods and florals that refreshes and intoxicates all at once. delicately creamy magnolia and sweet, fleshy gardenia and ylang ylang embrace smooth, robust cedarwood and cashmeran, while a sweet/spicy duo of black and pink pepper dance above the ground, each aspect enforcing and complimenting an aspect of the exquisite bergamot oil at the top of it all. tom ford has given fragrance's hardest working ingredient its very own feature- and we couldn't be happier."," bergamot, black pepper, pink pepper, ginger, ylang ylang, gardenia, cedar, pepperwood, magnolia, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber, cashmeran.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63541.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1392,la vierge de fer,Serge Lutens," serge lutens has a history of playful names that subtly subvert the fragrances they're attached to,   but naming a lush,   gentle lily after a medieval torture device might take the cake. ""la vierge de fer,  "" after all,   translates to ""the iron maiden,  "" that infamous spiked coffin more associated with heavy metal than french fragrance. but as always,   there's a method to the madness,   with la vierge revealing itself to be a beautiful lily-led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening and lightly metallic incense base suggest the maiden's deadly spikes with a wink and a smile.la vierge de fer opens,   as we mentioned,   with a bright dose of aldehydes,   charging the concoction with tingling energy and subtle sweetness. as the floral heart warms,   jasmine brings the luscious fullness,   while lily provides the edges,   fresh,   green and yes,   lightly metallic. this last,   thematically appropriate element is further reinforced with the incense base,   while the musk accentuates the sweetness that also carries throughout the life of this fragrance. sure,   we can see the subtleties that must have put a smile on the serge lutens team's faces when they chose to name this fragrance after the iron maiden. but to us,   this gorgeous,   sophisticated,   easy to wear floral is the opposite of torture."," aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36153.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1394,mojave ghost,BYREDO," in the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. the ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground. despite its arid surroundings and inability to produce nectar, the ghost flower, or mohavea confertiflora, maintains its perfect, majestic beauty and thrives year after year. in an astonishing feat of ingenuity, the flower uses mimicry to attract the pollinators of a neighboring plant species by developing markings that resemble those of a female bee, therefore attracting it and duping the male bee into following suit. this moving human-like behavior and captivating tale of survival lies in the foundation that inspired mojave ghost', an homage to this most bewitching flower.mojave ghost opens with a familiar yet mysterious fruit note, like a pear grown on another planet. languid and almost buttery ambrette and sandalwood facets smooth and stretch these slices of fruit into a golden desert sunset, with petals of violet and magnolia basking in its diminishing light.  warm woods and ambergris remain on the skin for hours, prolonging a magic desert twilight."," ambrette, sapodilla, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, ambergris, and cedar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1395,flowerhead,BYREDO," in the traditional indian wedding, flower heads are strung together on giant leis, including jaimala garlands which are exchanged between bride and groom as a token of mutual respect. couples are often showered with petals by the groom's brother for spiritual protection. flowers are abundant; from the mandap wedding canopy, which is entirely covered in exotic blooms, to the spiritual pooja rooms and verandahs, the explosion of colour is wildly celebratory and the scent is overwhelming.ben gorham, the visionary behind byredo, used his impression of a bride in a traditional indian wedding as his inspiration for flowerhead.the idea of marrying someone you don't know was very interesting. there's anxiety and excitement, and i described this person as a flowerhead', because the bride is completely covered in floral hair arrangements.flowerhead has definitely set our hearts a flutter. it's a bold yet modern white floral; on one hand, it uses the classic combination of sambac jasmine and tuberose for it's floral heart, but without the slightest touch of cream or indole usually associated with white florals. instead, the dryer aspect of white petals is blended with with a green rose, tart lemon and cranberry. angelica seed adds a celery-green herbal dimension. flowerhead doesn't shy away from the the classic white floral silage or volume. in fact we find this to be one of byredo's most robust compositions yet-- after a slow gorgeous drydown, flowerhead softens to a lingering wisper of suede and ambergris."," angelica seeds, cranberries, sicilian lemon, sambac jasmine, rose petals, tuberose, suede and ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1452,la religieuse,Serge Lutens," at turns delicate and animalic, pure and carnal, jasmine is rightfully considered one of perfumery's most versatile and valued notes.  both reverent and blasphemous, la religieuse (the nun) uses its jasmine to paint a portrait of a woman in full, where sweet and comforting give way to hidden depths of animalic desire, and ultimately, to freedom. la religieuse opens with a gourmand flourish, as the fresh, lightly green jasmine combines with sweet, sugared mimosa and smooth incense to evoke imagery of a saintly servant of god, pure in her devotion and intentions, bringing comfort and joy to those under her care. but as it evolves, and a more animalic civet note begins to coax out the other side of the jasmine, we realize that this woman has her own desires, her own fantasies, and her own yearning to escape the life that has been given to her. while the sweetness lingers, the incense now feels dirtier, the musk sexier. la religieuse never goes fully down and dirty, but the transition is thrillingly palpable: our heroine, while she might never go completely wild, is no longer content to be anyone's silent bride. once again, serge lutens has delivered us a gorgeous, encompassing fragrance that tells a story we won't soon forget."," jasmine, incense, civet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1490,heliotrope,Oriza L. Legrand," in the last 100 or so years, the heliotrope has been selectively bred to maximize its striking purple color, often sadly at the expense of its powerful, distinctive scent. how fortunate, therefore, that heliotrope blanc, created in 1886, honors the history of the flower by keeping the gorgeous vanilla-and-almond characteristics of heliotrope front and center. as a result, heliotrope blanc isn't just a fresh, elegantly blended floral with light gourmand touches- like all oriza l. legrand masterpieces, it's also a trip back through history. an exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level of this beautiful scent, opening alongside crisp violet leaves and orange blossom. in the heart, almond and mimosa draw out the heliotrope's indulgent side, drawing out the gourmand aspects of the flower while a sparkling iris keeps everything light and sheer. as heliotrope blanc dries down, musk and powder elements radiate softly, projecting timeless elegance. not every heliotrope flower may smell as wonderfully as they used to, but as long as oriza l. legrand is around, we're happy knowing we can still get a gorgeous dose of the past."," orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1492,03 apr 1968,Rundholz Parfums," the ethereal properties of incense have inspired ritual and spiritual fascination in disparate cultures across the globe since the early beginnings of civilization. from the austere resins of roman catholic incense to the tartness of indian ayurvedic blends, it's a material with endless facets but a single, deeply mystical, heart. this is the foundation upon which german designer lenka rundholz commissioned rundholz 03. apr. 1968, a fragrance intended not merely to capture a single aspect of incense, but to represent that most cherished substance in its totality. the result, delivered masterfully by arturetto landi, is stunning: an utterly unique blend of incenses at once wise and playful, sexy and welcoming, with an individuality of spirit that immediately announces the wearer as one who would prefer to set trends rather than follow them. a juicy lychee note provides unexpected fruitiness at the top, making a bold, fashionable statement, while a heart of heliotrope gives a softly savory complexity to the heart. the incense, meanwhile, is the undeniable star of the show- every facet of this magical substance, from dry to rich to sultry, weaves in and out from one another to create a scent that continues to delight as it lingers on the skin for hours. as rundholz has said, the moment-to-moment unpredictability is precisely the point- this gorgeous fragrance will manage to surprise you long after you've fallen in love with it."," lychee, heliotrope, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1493,nuit noire,Mona di Orio," dirty, dark and delicious, mona di orio's nuit noire is a throwback to perfumes worn by women who didn't work in offices, but rather used their scents to perfume fur, cigarettes... or other unmentionables.nuit noire starts with a surprisingly raunchy opening that combines cardamom and ginger with orange flower in a way that brings out the not-so-innocent orange flower's ripe-dirty side. from the beginning, nuit noire announces this perfume's rating: r, with a nod to triple-x. incense and cinnamon-clove spices combined with the carnal tuberose then dries down,  if you can take it!   to a barnyard-y animalic dirtiness from leather and musk, no doubt with some sandalwood lurking around in the background.although mona di orio's press materials asks us to imagine we're inthe souks, gardens, and hams of old tunis (of course nuit noire's notes reference old arabia), nuit noire's soul is decidedly film noir: erotic and dangerous."," orange flower, cardamom, ginger, orange guinee, olibanum, cinnamon, tuberose, sandalwood, clove, cedarwood, amber, leather, musk, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1496,doe in the snow,4160 Tuesdays," the beauty of sarah mccartney's playful, inventive creations lies in the specificity by which they're often created- inspired as she is by unique people, stories and requests, her scents are often more than a little out there- but they're never boring. doe in the snow, created for a customer's wintertime wedding, had a seemingly conflicting mission statement- make a big, fruity, mossy 60s/70s-style chypre, but make it cold.' the results are striking- citrus fruits, flowers and woods, stirred with an icicle. there's plenty of brightness from the grapefruit, yuzu and cedrat, but the cool, mossy leather notes and the sparkle of the aldehydes give a crisp chilliness to the light that feels like the sun rising across a frozen lake. do you love the profile of big, vintage fragrances, but are uncomfortable with the idea of your scent entering the room before you do? doe in the snow lets you have it both ways. graceful, yet practical, it's the casually opulent scent you never realized you needed."," grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64612.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1633,norne,Slumberhouse," few locations on earth bridge the gap between the terrestrial and the supernatural like the forests of the pacific northwest. dominated by towering old-growth trees, shrouded in fog and deciduous shadow, these forests represent the few remaining places where mankind's dominion over the planet is far from absolute, and the wisdom of nature still supersedes the passing concerns of civilization. with norne, slumberhouse aims to capture the essence of this mystical place, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary.one glance of the ominously beautiful bright-black liquid makes it clear that norne is far from a typical natural fragrance, and with the first powerful blast of fresh, resinous fir, it's confirmed. as the scent develops, other deeply complex woodland elements emerge: green moss, earthy fungus, fog, and a touch of slightly sweet incense that evokes images of a roaring campfire cutting through the damp air. while the clarity and strength of these notes is almost hard to believe, the explanation is simple: norne is made with 100% forest absolutes, a complicated and costly process that avoids synthetics and essential oils in favor of natural, powerful ingredients. the result is a fragrance of unparalleled potency and depth, entirely suited to its subject. for lovers of the outdoors, fragrance enthusiasts in search of the  truly unique, or anyone with a love for the ethereal, norne is not to be missed."," fog caked needle, lichen, fern, moss, hemlock, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1634,ore,Slumberhouse," gourmand fragrances aren't supposed to be dangerous, but nobody seems to have told slumberhouse. that's good news for all of us, because ore, with its sensuous heart of dry cocoa, lactonic balsams and dark wood, makes us think more of the bedroom than the dinner table. from the first smell of tantalizingly complex dry cocoa, it's evident that ore has no intention of following in the footsteps of a typical gourmand. this is a rich, raw cacao note that blends seamlessly into the dark guaiac and oakwood to evoke the kind of sensual decadence that has nothing to do with the calorie count. a boozy caramel delivers enough warmth to bring a comforting balance to the mystery and provides a backdrop for the creamy balsam that's quickly becoming creator josh lobb's signature. no matter how you feel about traditional gourmands, one smell of ore will be more than enough to make you hope that slumberhouse never stops breaking the rules."," oakwood, cocoa, mahogany, guaiac, dittany of crete (oregano), vanilla, whiskey lactone, peru resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1640,almost transparent blue,A Lab on Fire," almost transparent blue takes the classic elements of cologne and tweaks them to create a futuristic urban citrus, with hints of pavement and ink. the yuzu and lime in the opening are beautifully crystalline and sharply realistic, and the citrus stays crisp and sparkling as the scent evolves.  a brisk, hyper-real soap note emerges, with subtle hints of something industrial underneath. this has the stark feel of an abandoned city  a landscape carved in glass and steel, spare and stripped clean and angular, with empty monorail tracks slicing through the sky.  the chilly aldehydes are countered by warm cedar and the dry and clarifying scent of hinoki, the prized cypress that grows only in japan. hinoki wood is used to make the finest soaking baths and it has a distinctive, incense-like scent  airy, but haunting. our first impression of this was cool, clean and simple, but as we spend more time with it, we would strike the word simple. this ultramodern blend of citrus and wood has just enough strangeness to make it utterly compelling."," lime, yuzu, thyme flower, aldehyde, hinoki, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1641,rouge assassin,Jovoy Paris," two types of women from the twenties mingle in the same space without ever really meeting: one isla maitresse de ces messieurs, a mistress in the tradition of the second empire and thegarã§onne, a term for the emancipated woman, whose look may have been androgynous at times, but who rouge assassin pays tribute to those fearless, unstoppable women who upended the established order and broke all the rules. while the garã§onne look is sometimes considered masculine, femininity is what came through in the way women wore their hair and makeup, in their attitudes, their hunger for freedom and the insatiable desire to love without regard for social codes and conventions. she was the first in the history of women's fashion to reveal her legs. soon, brassieres would replace corsets. thick stockings vanished in favor of silk ones worn rolled over a garter above the knee. it was at this time that the first lipsticks appeared.the scent opens with the mysterious quality of both women's scents intermingling - sweet cigar smoke swirls and twirls in the dim light until it collides with a seductive cloud of powder.  everything is in silhouette as the scent draws you in to explore its development -  the lipstick iris and saturated rose notes give way to a plush cushion of ambrette, vanilla, and benzoin.  the cedar note lends a kick of smoke that evokes a bewitching image - a pair of glossy red lips smoking a clove cigarette.thanks to the collaboration of perfumer amã©lie bourgeois, rouge assassin is an homage to femininity that blends lipstick notes (iris butter), with the scent of skin (rice bran, musk, powdery floral accords) and echoes of parisian cabarets. men who wear it are either incurable risk-takers or they are machiavellian schemers."," bergamot, fresh rose, elemi, solar accord, iris, rice bran, ambrette seed, virginia cedar, white musk, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1650,mousse ii,Oliver & Co.," oliver & co.'s handcrafted fragrances are an intensely personal labor of love; created drop by drop to ensure that the end result is as spontaneous as it is satisfying. and while any other perfumer might be justifiably wary of tinkering with the unexpected balance of warm spice and cool musk that makes up the original mousse, oliver valverde is not any other perfumer. the result is mousse ii, a thrilling reinvention that plays like a virtuosic take on a jazz standard, adding invigorating new depth to a familiar favorite.  like its predecessor, mousse ii opens with the spicy warmth of clove against a strong backbone of sandalwood and oak moss. but while the original took its time to slowly develop its cool aldehyde and musk counterbalance, mousse ii ups the ante with a powerful blast of mint that immediately ties spicy and fresh together. as the fragrance dries on the skin, notes of lily of the valley and mexican lime weave together for a rich, bright green that blends vitality and lightness with the ever present warmth of clove without a hint of contradiction. many fragrances claim to offer perfect balance, but very few manage to pull it off with such creative panache. with mousse ii, oliver & co. stands alone.this perfume is a re-envisioning of the original mousse eau de toilette that was originally released in 2011."," sandalwood mysore, clove bud madagascar, lavender absolute, lime peel from mexico, mint, aldehydes, cardamom guatemala, musk, ambergris, muguet.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1652,vetiverus,Oliver & Co.," if you love the pure, smoky sexiness of vetiver the way we do, it can be frustrating to try fragrances that hide it behind other powerful ingredients in the name ofbalance. vetiverus most certainly does not have this problem. by selecting complementary notes that almost entirely accentuate and highlight the sweet earthiness of the namesake ingredient, oliver & co. have bucked tradition yet again with that rare vetiver fragrance that proudly refuses to apologize for being a vetiver. in keeping with this philosophy, vetiverus opens dramatically with an exquisitely deep and mysterious vetiver, at once smoky and velvety rich, reminiscent of les nez's cult classic turtle vetiver exercise 1. and rather than undercut that raw power, vetiverus goes all in, with labdanum, leather, patchouli and clove serving to reinforce and extend the natural depth and warmth. a base of musk keeps everything standing upright, while the subtle sweetness of osmanthus flowers provides rich smoothness. plenty of great fragrances feature vetiver. but for the true vetiver enthusiast searching for an unapologetic, uncompromising showcase of the sublimely smoky, there is perhaps no substitute for vetiverus."," labdanum, styrax, vetiver, ambergris, osmanthus flower, orange peel, patchouly, musk, coriander seed, clove bud.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1841,aventus,Creed," the exceptional aventus was inspired by the dramatic life of a historic emperor, celebrating strength, power and success. introduced in 2010 and crafted by the deft hand of sixth generation master perfumer olivier creed in collaboration with his son erwin, this scent has grown to become the best-selling fragrance in the history of the brand. olivier created its iconic name derived from a (""from"") ventus (""the wind""), illustrating the aventus man as destined to live a driven life, ever galloping with the wind at his back toward success. aventus is a sophisticated blend for individuals who savor a life well-lived. what we think a phenomenon in its own right, aventus is a fragrance that is groundbreaking in its use of bright apple and pineapple notes."," bergamot, blackcurrant leaves, apple, pineapple, pinkberries, birch, patchouli, jasmine, musk, oakmoss, ambergris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49365.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1842,knize ten,Knize," joseph knize, one of its inventors lived in vienna and was a supplier to the royal and imperial court. the fragrance we offer, knize ten, has been available since 1925. the great author hans habe once said that, if he were cast away on a desert island, he would take knize with him, since, for a man using a toilet water, it was really not so much a matter of undermining the morale of a beautiful woman than boosting one's own. the brilliant designer and poster artist ernst deutsch-dryden played a decisive role in the composition of knize. knize was the most famous men's outfitter in vienna. his shop still exists today with a much-admired interior, one of the great works of the architect and designer adolf loos. knize ten is one of the few fragrances to have distinct note of leather. perfumers, who are capable of lyricism equal to that of wine connoisseurs, differentiate between the top, heart and base note of a fragrance and sense chords and cadences in the combination of these three. the top note of knize is citrus-fresh with petitgrain, orange, rosemary and bergamot; the heart note is dry to woody with cedars and sandalwood, and the base note is leathery with castor and ambergris. in view of its age, knize is not, of course, a fully synthetic perfume. it contains costly natural substances - patchouli wood, lemon, orris, clove and orange blossom amongst others."," lemon, bergamot, orange, petitgrain, rosemary,  geranium, rose, cedar, orris, carnation, cinnamon, orange blossom, sandalwood, leather, musk, moss, patchouli, ambergris, castoreum and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1844,sartorial,Penhaligons," after offering the masterfully sensuous amaranthine last year to the ladies, penhaligon's, as befits a traditional english house, has turned its attention to gentlemen. as an inspiration for sartorial, bertrand duchaufour launched into an olfactory exploration of the savile row bespoke tailor norton & son's workshop. the odorant threads he's teased out compose a radically new vision of the most traditional masculine fragrance family, the fougã¨re.  lavender acts as a reference both to the fougã¨re and to a typically english scent. boosted by aldehydes and ozonic materials, it conjures the steam rising from hot irons on tweeds  fear not, there isn't the least hint of the aquatic in the blend --, the scissors and sewing machines. the dusty leather of club chairs and mounted hunting trophies springs from the combination of black pepper, gurjum wood, oakmoss and a leather accord. patchouli and cedar rubbed in beeswax and honey soften the hard edges of the leather and metallic effects and smoothly wrap the blend, just as the waxed floors and cupboards bathe the tailor's shop in a warm, fatty-animalic glow. duchaufour aficionados may recognize a trace of that signature green pepper note he's dropped into many of his compositions.as the quintessential english dandy and couturier to the queen hardy amies once said:a man should look as if he bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, then forgot about them. that's sartorial: tough and smooth, playful and elegant, impeccably tailored and as easy to wear as a bespoke suit."," aldehydes, ozonic effect, metallic effect, violet leaf, neroli, cardamom, black pepper, fresh ginger, beeswax, cyclamen, linden blossom, lavender, leather, gurjum wood, patchouli, myrrh, cedar wood, tonka bean, oakmoss, white musk, honey effect, old wood effect, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1845,memoir man,Amouage," the releases from the house of amouage over the past three years have had a uniting thread: uncomporomised richness and beauty.  their new series memoir presents a new chapter in this narrative as conceived by creative director, christopher chong. turning the industry norm of a dominant woman's fragrance on its head, chong instead conceived the two memoir fragrances from an inherently male point of view. together, the memoir fragrances offer a new interpretation of the space' between man and woman, one that is almost impossible to resist.memoir man is a fougã¨re, one that fractures the standard mix of lavender and oakmoss into bright shards by the addition of basil and mint and the further aspect of absinth.  like a tray of unset gems the topnotes sparkle on the skin, leading into heart notes of woods and a rich, smooth base of vanilla, amber and the traditional oakmoss.  inspired by baudelaire's flã¢neur who walked the city in order to experience it, the scent brings to mind the richness that is paris. as the ""gentleman stroller"" he is a living duality: both observer and observed, spectator and participant. won't you take his hand?"," basil, mint, frankincense, lavender, rose, oakmoss, leather, tobacco, absinth, wormwood, sandalwood, guaiac wood, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1846,une rose vermeille,Tauer Perfumes," a divinely saucy rose scent that flounces and shimmies and flirts its way into your heart and never lets you go. the opening is bright and juicy citrus with a hint of lavender  and then the vermillion rose unfurls its luscious petals. as you would expect from andy tauer, the rose is exceptionally vivid and true  deep and velvety and spicy, with a peppery bite that acts as the perfect foil to a delicious, intensely concentrated essence of raspberry. this is a raspberry that you would pick in a dream  the most perfect berry of the summer - so bright and pure and sweet that you would cry if you woke up before tasting another. the sparkling rose and raspberry jam is folded into a creamy base of vanilla, tonka bean and smooth sandalwood, taking us right to the brink of gourmand, but not quite crossing over. there is definitely an edible quality to une rose vermeille  it conjures up marzipan and meringue and bavarian cream  but it isn't pure dessert due to the startling freshness of the rose and the deep purr of the sandalwood. this rose is not just charming and delectable and adorably feminine, but a bit naughty, as well. stunning."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, rose, raspberry, violet, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1847,cuir  les nombres dor,Mona di Orio," rarely do leather scents come across our path that put us in a state of delightful shock. opening with a whiff of gauloise-like smoke it quickly becomes toasted spices and sweet absinthe before the appearance of the leather. neatly straddling the line between biker and birkin bag, the leather is almost carnal in its depth. in these days of anodyne scents and trans-fat free lives this is a welcome walk on the wild side that on a man would be wonderful. on a woman? the only way to put it: cuir is ruthlessly chic."," cardamom, absinth, leather, cade, resinoid opoponax, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1852,uden,Xerjoff," xerjoff classifies uden as a marine fougere, meaning that it smells of lavender, oak moss, and the sea. to us, although accurate in some ways, it simplifies uden's unique complexity. if uden is a marine scent, then its waters surround the bahamas, where ancient traders traveled weeks across the treacherous atlantic to barter for coffee and rum, both of which give uden a delicious warmth. the rum and coffee are then packed in rough wood crates, which pick up the salty scent of the ocean as the boat's wooden timbers rock on the waves for further journey in the new world. uden's ocean is the world of the seamen who risked their lives traversing the seas to bring the pleasure of the exotic to long ago drawing rooms.uden opens with lavender and citrus, the harbingers of a traditional fougere. however, instead of traveling the clean, smooth path for which it seems destined, coffee and rum absolutes add their familiar, delicious notes. combined with uden's opening, the coffee and rum create an unfamiliar--yet completely tantalizing--heart to the fragrance. uden dries down into a warm medley of wood infused with clean musk, providing a counterpoint to its sweet rum, rich coffee, and crisp citrus-lavender. uden reminds us that wild worlds may belie the simplest pleasures."," grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1853,kobe,Xerjoff," in kobe, xerjoff created something unusual, yet somehow inevitable: a dry citrus, warm woody fragrance for men. kobe smells like a finely crafted wooden box full of vividly scented citrus rinds. the wood of the box is of the best quality and from a mix of exotic trees, and the citrus peels inside are remarkably potent, but play more as spice than fruit. this marriage of tart and spicy with sweet and warm is what makes kobe such a singular fragrance.kobe opens with a bracing grapefruit rind note rounded out with petitgrain (an oil extracted from the green twigs of the bitter orange) and bright neroli. it feels fresh and alive, like opening a window on a crisp morning to an orange grove in early spring just as tight blossoms begin to push from the orange trees. after a few minutes, green wood begins to join the sharp citrus. the wood seems to age and sweeten over time to become more resinous and balsamic, transforming kobe into an extraordinary, deep woody scent. it isn't just any wood, though. a vein of oud, an unusual, intimate aroma, runs through the fragrance of shaved rose wood. fresh and warm, sweet and tart, kobe is a fragrance for any time and anywhere."," calabrese bergamot, florida orange, southern italian neroli, paraguayan petitgrain, rose wood, resins, oud wood, palisander, tonka, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

1857,vetyverio,Diptyque," the core of vetyverio features two of the vetiver's amazing properties. the first, from indonesia, is earthy, rough and splendidly reminiscent of unspoiled nature. the second is more subtle and delicate and hails from the caribbean. less known? no longer! this vetiver from haiti is the perfect blend for the musks that cut through the formula: it completes it, tempers it, and adds a new  and remarkable  quality to it.these essences are distilled by the two systems steam and fractional distillation and add up to almost an overdose (25% of the total), which avoids intensifying the blend with synthetic input. at the end, a few spices  carrot seeds with sparkling apricot essence, nutmeg and clove  add the last surprise. the majestic cedar wood's radical dryness structures the whole effect and the powdery musk draws a nothing but sensual line on the skin.vetyverio is subtle, sensitive, and captures the power of unquestionable elegance."," mandarin orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, vetiver, carrot seed, apricot, nutmeg, clove, ylang ylang, turkish rose, geranium, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48397.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
